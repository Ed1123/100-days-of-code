# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 3

The log of my #100DaysOfCode - Round 3 challenge. Started on [Tuesday August 4th, 2020].

## Log

### Day 1: August 4, 2020 (Starting a new round - shortest_paths.py)

**Today's Progress**: I'm doing a 3rd round of this challenge to finish the UCSD DSA specialization.
Today it was the second class of CS50x. It was a good way to solidify my CS knowledge.
I also found a big bug in my shortest_path.py code. Tomorrow I will debug it. :)

**Thoughts:** Feeling good besides being kind of a stressful day.

### Day 0: August 5, 2020 (A break)

**Today's Progress**: I got the job! :D I'm taking a break from the challenge today to celebrate a little bit my new job. Because of that, I won't consider yesterday as the first day of the 3rd round.

**Thoughts:** Feeling exited.

### Day 1: August 6, 2020 (Minimum Spanning Tree)

 **Today's Progress**: I learned about MST in graphs and two implementations. Kruskalâ€™s and Primâ€™s algorithms. A good start for this new round. ðŸ˜Š

 **Thoughts:** A difficult day. Feeling a bit better.

### Day 2: August 7, 2020 (Reading)

**Today's Progress**: Reading the book for a deep understanding of the MST lesson. I also started to solve the problem of finding the MST of a set of points given just its x and y coordinates. I'm weighting Kruskal's or Prim's algorithms running time in this special case.

**Thoughts:** Feeling ok. Nothing too bad, nothing too god.

### Day 3: August 8, 2020 (Coding connecting_points.py)

**Today's Progress**: Kind of stuck in small details. I'll work harder.

**Thoughts:** Feeling ok. A little bit overwhelmed.

### Day 4: August 9, 2020 (connecting_points.py :heavy_check_mark: )

**Today's Progress**: After a hectic day I finished coding my problem with a clearest mind. Surprisingly, it passes the grader tests in the first try.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good :smile:.

### Day 5: August 10, 2020 (Thinking clustering.py)

**Today's Progress**: Analyzing how to approach the problem of clustering. It seems that using Kruskal's algorithm is the easiest way to do it.

**Thoughts:** I have plenty of things to do. This weekend may get entertain. Feeling fine.
