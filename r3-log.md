# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 3

The log of my #100DaysOfCode - Round 3 challenge. Started on [Tuesday August 4th, 2020].

## Log

### Day 1: August 4, 2020 (Starting a new round - shortest_paths.py)

**Today's Progress**: I'm doing a 3rd round of this challenge to finish the UCSD DSA specialization.
Today it was the second class of CS50x. It was a good way to solidify my CS knowledge.
I also found a big bug in my shortest_path.py code. Tomorrow I will debug it. :)

**Thoughts:** Feeling good besides being kind of a stressful day.

### Day 0: August 5, 2020 (A break)

**Today's Progress**: I got the job! :D I'm taking a break from the challenge today to celebrate a little bit my new job. Because of that, I won't consider yesterday as the first day of the 3rd round.

**Thoughts:** Feeling exited.

### Day 1: August 6, 2020 (Minimum Spanning Tree)

 **Today's Progress**: I learned about MST in graphs and two implementations. Kruskalâ€™s and Primâ€™s algorithms. A good start for this new round. ðŸ˜Š

 **Thoughts:** A difficult day. Feeling a bit better.

### Day 2: August 7, 2020 (Reading)

**Today's Progress**: Reading the book for a deep understanding of the MST lesson. I also started to solve the problem of finding the MST of a set of points given just its x and y coordinates. I'm weighting Kruskal's or Prim's algorithms running time in this special case.

**Thoughts:** Feeling ok. Nothing too bad, nothing too god.

### Day 3: August 8, 2020 (Coding connecting_points.py)

**Today's Progress**: Kind of stuck in small details. I'll work harder.

**Thoughts:** Feeling ok. A little bit overwhelmed.

### Day 4: August 9, 2020 (connecting_points.py :heavy_check_mark: )

**Today's Progress**: After a hectic day I finished coding my problem with a clearest mind. Surprisingly, it passes the grader tests in the first try.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good :smile:.

### Day 5: August 10, 2020 (Thinking clustering.py)

**Today's Progress**: Analyzing how to approach the problem of clustering. It seems that using Kruskal's algorithm is the easiest way to do it.

**Thoughts:** I have plenty of things to do. This weekend may get entertain. Feeling fine.  

### Day 6: August 11, 2020 (Finish coding and start debugging)

**Today's Progress**: After implementing my idea from yesterday I come across expected bugs. I don't know where this last bug is yet, but I have a pretty good idea for finding it tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** 1st day at this job and I still can't believe I'm in. Things are looking pretty good. Tomorrow it'll be my first meeting in English with my team. Feeling exited and nervous. D:

### Day 7: August 12, 2020 (clustering.py :heavy_check_mark:)

**Today's Progress**: I found the bug (and some others alongside that one), I fix them and I submit the code to get a great score. :)
Starting next last and optional week in the course. I need to organized to finish it before I get the financial aid for the next course and also finished the homework for the CS50x class. Feeling the pressure. D:

**Thoughts:** A tiring day. I have to keep going. There are only two days of to the weekend. Feeling tired.

### Day 8: August 13, 2020 (CS50x - Problem set 0 - Scratch)

**Today's Progress**: Starting with my scratch project. I have to manage my expectations before it goes out of control and wanted to code a new super videogame. So far doing well.

**Thoughts:** Mix feelings. Job is doing good, couple not that much, neither family. Feeling fine. I'm going to bed early.

### Day 9: August 14, 2020 (CS50x - Problem set 0 - Scratch :heavy_check_mark: )

**Today's Progress**: Finished the little little game. It looks good and it has room for improvement, but I think that due to my time limitations I will just let it there as it is for now. I may take the time to improve it later on.

**Thoughts:** Kind of heavy day. A good day overall, though. Feeling fine.

### Day 10: August 15, 2020 (CS50x - Problem set 1 - 2/3 :heavy_check_mark:)

**Today's Progress**: I finished the first 2/3 exercises of the problem set 1. 2 introductory problems that I think give a very good base knowledge of the C programing language.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good. Not the super active and productive day, but it is my weekend so I'm just enjoying it (while, of course, coding at least one hour).

### Day 11: August 16, 2020 (CS50x - Problem set 1 - 3/3 :heavy_check_mark:)

**Today's Progress**: Code the last problem for the week 1 in C. I though it was gonna take much less time, but I wasn't at my top performance so it was expected.

**Thoughts:** Not my best day. I pass the day, though. Feeling a little bad.

### Day 12: August 17, 2020 (Bidirectional Dijkstra and A* algorithms)

**Today's Progress**: I'm finding this topic particularly hard. Dijkstra's algorithm already wasn't the easiest thing I've learned and this two are built on top of that. I'm a bit worry for not being able to understand well this algorithms.

**Thoughts:** A hard day. Work is going well, family same, couple not much and me... I've had had better days. Feeling bad.

### Day 13: August 18, 2020 (Contraction Hierarchies)

**Today's Progress**: This advanced shortest paths subject is being pretty complicated. I'm having a hard time understanding these algorithms and theirs implementations. May be when coding them I got illuminated.

**Thoughts:** Having a hard time. I think it is because of the stress cause by the fears of not being up to the new job I have gotten. I don't feel prepare and I'm scare. Feeling down.

### Day 14: August 19, 2020 (Contraction Hierarchies)

**Today's Progress**: I don't understand.

**Thoughts:** Nice day at work, not that great at home. Feeling even more down.

### Day 15: August 20, 2020 (Finally understanding)

**Today's Progress**: Computerphile YouTube channel was my hero! Thanks Dr. Mike Pound! I'm finally understanding how Dijkstra's and A* algorithms. I think now I just need to review the videos (or just the slides) of the course to learn the implementation and may be even the proves of the algorithms, but one step at a time before I get crazy.

**Thoughts:** A nice day overall (even though, my dog wasn't behaving well :sweat:). Feeling better thanks to my advance in my job, the nice resolution of a problem with a client, new bikes I get to see and meeting with a friend after a long time. Of course also because I'm moving on in the DSA course.

### Day 16: August 21, 2020 (MIT OpenCourseWare)

**Today's Progress**: I watch (and take giant notes) a MIT class from professor Srini Devadas on Speeding up Dijkstra where he explains bidirectional Dijkstra, the notion of potential functions for modified weights and how the landmarks come as a application of the latest. Awesome explanation that really helped me understand what I couldn't in my main UCSD DSA course.

**Thoughts:** Life is going up and down and it is a constant fight to keep it balance. It is very hard sometimes, but I'm still here. I thing is how life is supposed to be. Feeling fine.

### Day 17: August 22, 2020 (Playing with more MIT classes)

**Today's Progress**: Watching more classes and trying to start solving the coding problem of bidirectional Dijkstra.

**Thoughts:** A very tiring and productive day. Feeling good.

### Day 18: August 23, 2020 (Coding bidirectional Dijkstra)

**Today's Progress**: It is being challenging. Most because of I'm trying to make sense of the starting code I was provided with. Usually, if I have the algorithm clear I just ignored the hints and code it my way. This time, however, I think it would be easy if I just attach to the guidelines. Moreover because I had problems understanding it. I'm moving at an slow pace.

**Thoughts:** Feeling ok. Not a great, neither a bad day. The greatest, Bayern won the champions; the worst, I couldn't fix the laptop yet, neither finish all my plans. They certainty weren't few. Something went wrong that I ended up with this many pending tasks for my weekend. It may've been the unexpected breaking of my mom's laptop. I still have some time between work and my coding hour, I think.

### Day 19: August 24, 2020 (Actually coding bidirectional Dijkstra)

**Today's Progress**: I'm considering ignoring the hints now that I think I understand better how the algorithm works. It may take longer to understand how to use those hints than actually coding the solution.

**Thoughts:** Feeling well. It was a balanced day. Nothing too high, neither too low. Tired at evening I fell asleep and wake up to finished some tasks and my coding hour.

### Day 20: August 25, 2020 (Still coding bidirectional Dijkstra)

**Today's Progress**: Making huge progress in the code. I'm missing the part for finding the node x where the value of df(x) + db(x) is minimum or finding the shortest path.

**Thoughts:** A good day overall. A bad morning lead me to have a difficult day at work, but nothing too crazy. Tomorrow I'll have several hours to finish all the pending tasks.

### Day 21: August 26, 2020 (Finishing up bidirectional Dijkstra)

**Today's Progress**: I finished the code and it worked at the first try, but it had something that make it too slow for one test so I tried to improve it. While doing so I broke it and now I'm debugging it ^^u.

**Thoughts:** A good day. Tiring, full of activities and nothing bad happening. Feeling ok.

### Day 22: August 27, 2020 (Bidirectional Dijkstra :heavy_check_mark: )

**Today's Progress**: After debugging and reading for solutions on the forums of the course I've finished optimizing my code and it passed the test. I also started with the next course, Algorithms on Strings. I think I'll leave these extra part on graph for another time. My priority now is finishing this course.

**Thoughts:** A terrible day at work. I hope it doesn't have that bad consequences.

### Day 23: August 28, 2020 (Playing around with bash)

**Today's Progress**: Playing with bash on the WSL following The Missing Semester of Your CS Education. The fact they're using Linux laptops and are teaching bash in 2020 brought back my thoughts of switching to Linux on my laptop. I've tried it and force me to use it for some tasks, but never installed on my main computer. Why not living in between both worlds?

**Thoughts:** A better day at work. I did some progress on that task that seem unreachable, but I feel that it is not enough. Well see on Monday.

### Day 24: August 29, 2020 (Tries)

**Today's Progress**: I learned about tries in pattern matching on strings. Complex and interesting stuff.

**Thoughts:** Feeling fine. Not an excellent day, but I'm still alive so it's ok.

### Day 25: August 30, 2020 (vim)

**Today's Progress**: Couldn't focus on the main readings on tries, neither the coding assignments. That's why I just ended up watching the lecture 3 of the missing semester on vim. It's kind of relaxing.

**Thoughts:** A difficult day. Not that bad as other, though. Feeling a little bad.

### Day 26: August 31, 2020 (Coding trie)

**Today's Progress**: I was complicating my life too much when planning the code. Now I have an simple implementation idea. I know I'll work.

**Thoughts:** Feeling confident and good (again). Life is hard, but now I love it. Ha! Feeling good.

### Day 27: September 1st, 2020 (Making the code work)

**Today's Progress**: I though I'd be easier. Trying to make my code work. It at least run without errors, but  outputting the wrong answer. Debugging it won't be that difficult.

**Thoughts:** I'm also trying to make run for everything in my life. Work, study, home (my room in this case), personal care (working out and nutrition), games, friends, couple and family. It is difficult to keep everything in balance, but I'm going on. Feeling ok.

### Day 28: September 2, 2020 (trie_matching.py)

**Today's Progress**: I made good progress today. I finished debugging yesterday's problem and finished the second one. It was kind of easy.

**Thoughts:** The day felt really short. I couldn't do my exercises. Too much time gaming? I'm finishing kind of early though. It is midnight compare to the 1:00 am when I usually turn off my laptop. Feeling ok.

### Day 29: September 3, 2020 (trie_matching_improved and suffix_tree.)

**Today's Progress**: I finished the next problem with some simple modifications because I already made the firsts pretty general. Now, this next problem, building an space efficient suffix tree is taking me some time. I think may using logarithmic time to find the position where to break the string may be one way. I'm not sure, but I want to go bed early so tomorrow we'll see.

**Thoughts:** Feeling ok. Not my greatest day at job, but I think it'll get better. Hopefully tomorrow is the last day of the week.

### Day 30: September 4, 2020 (Suffix tree)

**Today's Progress**: Thinking and researching before tackling the problem. It seems kind of hard to implement. I didn't come up with the algorithm by myself at that make me feel not so great.

**Thoughts:** A good day at work and at home. I couldn't do my workout, but it's ok. Feeling ok.

### Day 31: September 5, 2020 (Playing with my Pi)

**Today's Progress**: Recovering access to my pi over SSH, mastering screenshots over it to get the current status. Then, I also paly with my Windows Terminal config to easily access my Pi, customizing the looks of it and some key bindings.

**Thoughts:** Anxiety took a big place during my day. I wasn't that good, but at the end it wasn't that bad. Highs and downs as always. Fine overall. Feeling fine.

### Day 32: September 6, 2020 (A light - New try on matching_with_mismatches.py)

**Today's Progress**: I was wandering in information related to the last problem, building a suffix tree, but I wasn't getting anywhere (I think that's the point of wandering lol). After a mail with a suggestion on how to approach the left behind matching_with_mismatches.py problem I get interested on trying something. Even though the mail doesn't give me much clue in where my problem might be, it gave a sign of improvement. I improve my code with a little addition, submit it and it didn't pass with the same error. I research a little to find possible test cases I wasn't taking into consideration when I came with the idea of limiting the letters of the alphabet I was using for stress testing. I think that came from the suffix tree idea of efficiency when having a limited alphabet.
I tried with 3 letters and large sequences of text and pattern, but it seemed to passed all, but without finding much matches, so I decided to try with just 2 letters, the minimum than doesn't generate consecutive matches. I let the test run for some time when suddenly an error!
The interpreter caught an error, but I didn't have the test case for that error, so with some work (and after learning to handle exceptions in Python) I find a test case to reproduce the error.
I'm so exited for this. I'm just starting to debug it so it is too soon to make conclusions, but having a test case to reproduce an error in my seemingly perfect code is a HUGE step. Tomorrow I'll debug it and get that 100% I want in all courses.

**Thoughts:** Not my greatest day, but I'm trying to keep myself in a good mood. Feeling fine.

### Day 33: September 7, 2020 (Debugging)

**Today's Progress**: I spend the whole time reviewing notes and formulas about polynomial hashing. I've found that my error is in the binary search logic. I'm trying to solve it. The solution seems to be close, but it's already late to pursue it.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good. Not a bad day. I worked out pretty well.

### Day 34: September 8, 2020 (FINALLY!)

**Today's Progress**: I solve the problem with the binary search logic and my algorithm passed the test it was constantly failing in. It didn't pass all the tests due to time limitations, but after some time spend improving it, IT FINALLY PASS THE GRADER!

**Thoughts:** Besides the great emotion of finally getting my 100% in this course, I had a good day. At work and with myself. My relationship is not in its greatest moments, but I know how to fix it. I hope I get organized. Feeling good.

### Day 35: September 9, 2020 (A tiring day)

**Today's Progress**:

- C, bash, make
- Raspberry Pi / VSCode remote coding

**Thoughts:** A tiring day where I couldn't do much for waiting. Feeling a little bad.

### Day 36: September 10, 2020 (Thinking and coding suffix_tree.py)

**Today's Progress**: It is a difficult problem, but I'm starting to code it. I'm gonna try traverse the trie constructed from the suffixes to compress it. We'll see how it works.

**Thoughts:** Feeling fine. Not the greatest day either.

### Day 37: September 11, 2020 (Functional programming)

**Today's Progress**: Getting introduce to functional programming. I... don't know.

**Thoughts:** Tired. Feeling a bit overwhelmed. 

### Day 38: September 12, 2020 (Making progress on the suffix_tree.py)

**Today's Progress**: I coded a very naÃ¯ve working algorithm. If I can't make it pass the tests through improvements on its running time I still have this algorithm for stress testing. (also coding it help me gain confidence to approach this difficult problem)

**Thoughts:** Feeling better.

### Day 39: September 13, 2020 (Reading)

**Today's Progress**: I get stuck on trying to compress each label of my current algorithm. I don't wanna make my algorithm too slow or too space heavy and I simply don't find an way of implementing my ideas. So, I started looking on the internet for help and ended up in a [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9452701/ukkonens-suffix-tree-algorithm-in-plain-english) answer that explains the "advance" Ukkonen's linear implementation. I'm gonna read it and we'll see how is goes.

**Thoughts:** I'm keeping this Sunday light to rest enough for this next week. Feeling ok.

### Day 40: September 14, 2020 (Progress?)

**Today's Progress**: Ukkonen's algorithm is really complex and I think out of the scope of the course (not for nothing it is suggested not to use it). Going back to a more "basic" implementation.
I think the problem in my original naÃ¯ve algorithm can be solved by just creating a copy dictionary to store the edge indexes information. The problem with not knowing how to find the indexes of the label to compress them may be solve that way. Although, I'm still bother by the slowness of that approach.
Next I'm considering creating the suffix tree from scratch by creating a new node when branching as suggested. That may be easier than trying to fix the path compression approach. Working on a pseudocode that'll help me with the algorithm.

**Thoughts:** It was an ok day at job, ok at home and ok with studies. Feeling good.

### Day 41: September 15, 2020 (Pseudocoding)

**Today's Progress**: I went back to write a pseudocode for my ideas from yesterday. I think I have a good solution that I've already started implementing.

**Thoughts:** Feeling ok. Just a little worried for my partner's development.

### Day 42: September 16, 2020 (Making considerable progress)

**Today's Progress**: I think I'm gonna need just another hour to finish the code.

**Thoughts:** I was a lazy day, but I manage to go through it. Feeling ok.

### Day 43: September 17, 2020 (A good code to debug)

**Today's Progress**: My code works well until it doesn't. I need a better way to find what edge to break when inserting a new suffix into the trie. 

**Thoughts:** A hard day. I'm trying to keep moving. Feeling a little bad.

### Day 44: September 18, 2020 (Almost there)

**Today's Progress**: Now the code works in all simple test cases. Currently I'm debugging an error with a large input. Not sure what is wrong, but I'll see it tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good. A productive day. I need to solve finish other 2 tasks to feel free and not pressure by them.

### Day 45: September 19, 2020 (A tiring day)

**Today's Progress**: I cleaned my code. Now it is easier to debug. I'm tired to finished it today. At least it now makes more sense.

**Thoughts:** A good day overall. I just need to convince that client what my work is worth. Feeling fine.

### Day 46: September 20, 2020 (CS50!)

**Today's Progress**: Going back to the 2nd CS50x class. It is kind of a break from my main code to relax and come back with fresh to debug my code of a suffix tree.

**Thoughts:** Feeling very good. A really good day. Things went as plan and I even had time to bike a little around home. I really enjoy a beautiful sunsets.

### Day 47: September 21, 2020 (CS50 / Debug)

**Today's Progress**: Finishing some details of the yesterday's class and debugging my suffix tree.

**Thoughts:** A sluggish day. Feeling ok.

### Day 48: September 22, 2020 (Success!)

**Today's Progress**: It's been almost 3 weeks since I first encountered the suffix tree problem. Jumping in and out the problem. I finally did it. It is a decent understandable and tidy O(n^2) implementation. I'm happy with the results.
The next problem looks challenging also. I'll try to finish it tomorrow in just one day. Wish me luck.

**Thoughts:** It's being hard to keep the equilibrium in my life. Feeling down.

### Day 49: September 23, 2020 (Visualizing graphs (networks) in Python)

**Today's Progress**: After thinking about how to approach the problem I wanted to visually analyze my suffix tree in search for solutions and I ended up diving deep into graphs, aka networks, software, packages, etc. Also into a little bit of graph theory. I like sidetracking sometimes (when my inner me allows it).

**Thoughts:** I know, I was supposed to solve the problem today. It wasn't a good day and I barely manage to do the basic stuff. I hope tomorrow will be a better day. Feeling down.

### Day 50: September 24, 2020 (Thinking)

**Today's Progress**: Not much. Trying to understand how to find the shortest non-shared substring in a Text1#Text2$ suffix tree.

**Thoughts:** A better day. I'm tired, though. Feeling better.

### Day 51: September 25, 2020 (Rethinking and CS50x homework)

**Today's Progress**: Thinking the problem from yesterday. It certainly is a difficult problem. Also worked on the homework for this week of the CS50x course making a program that calculates the Coleman-Liau index (a little simplified).

**Thoughts:** Feeling ok. I managed to get through the day. 

### Day 52: September 26, 2020 (readability.c :white_check_mark:)

**Today's Progress**: Today I haven't had much time or space to focus so I just finish the readability problem in C. It is a good practice of C. I kind of like the {} syntax, but I miss many of my Python coding style.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good. Life is being kind this days. I'm gonna try to keep this mood.

### Day 53: September 27, 2020 (substitution.c)

**Today's Progress**: Working on the second problem on CS50x homework. I'm coming across with C problems. It is always interesting to debug.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good. A good day, even though I haven't worked out. 

### Day 54: September 28, 2020 (substitution.c :white_check_mark:)

**Today's Progress**: Facing a lot of problems with C and learning a lot of things modern computer languages give us for granted. Segmentation fault, how to negate an statement, initializing an array of variable length with false values, converting an string to uppercase char by char, mapping each char in a fixed length array and printing an array. It is being great to learn C. It's given me a whole new view on how computers really work. There's no magic.

**Thoughts:** I felt tired most of the day, but got revitalize at night. Life being a night owl. Feeling good, though. :)

### Day 55: September 29, 2020 (shortest non-shared substring)

**Today's Progress**: I think I'm getting how to implement the algorithm thanks to the suggestions on the discuss forum, but I don't quite understand why is it like that. May be while implementing it I will.

**Thoughts:** Not the greatest day. Feeling fine.

### Day 56: September 30, 2020 (shortest non-shared substring)

**Today's Progress**: I can't... at least for today...

**Thoughts:** Not a great day.

### Day 57: October 1st, 2020 (shortest non-shared substring)

**Today's Progress**: Reading and trying to find something to read online, a hint to help me understand the problem and thinking on a way to code the problem.  No much progress, though. I hope someone answers my [stackoverlow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/64166835/10864988?stw=2).

**Thoughts:** Starting to feel overwhelmed by this problem. I'd like to move in the [Hacktoberfest](hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com) direction, but I feel like I have to finish this problem first. I may just postpone it for another month or so... damn. Feeling overwhelmed.

### Day 58: October 2nd, 2020 (shortest non-shared substring)

**Today's Progress**: I hope this simple implementation fits into the given memory and time limits. I also watch a conference by Raymond Hettinger at PyBay2019, [The Mental Game of Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uwuv05aZ6ug).

**Thoughts:** Feeling down. I just went through the day.
