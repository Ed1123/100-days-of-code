# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 3

The log of my #100DaysOfCode - Round 3 challenge. Started on [Tuesday August 4th, 2020].

## Log

### Day 1: August 4, 2020 (Starting a new round - shortest_paths.py)

**Today's Progress**: I'm doing a 3rd round of this challenge to finish the UCSD DSA specialization.
Today it was the second class of CS50x. It was a good way to solidify my CS knowledge.
I also found a big bug in my shortest_path.py code. Tomorrow I will debug it. :)

**Thoughts:** Feeling good besides being kind of a stressful day.

### Day 0: August 5, 2020 (A break)

**Today's Progress**: I got the job! :D I'm taking a break from the challenge today to celebrate a little bit my new job. Because of that, I won't consider yesterday as the first day of the 3rd round.

**Thoughts:** Feeling exited.

### Day 1: August 6, 2020 (Minimum Spanning Tree)

 **Today's Progress**: I learned about MST in graphs and two implementations. Kruskalâ€™s and Primâ€™s algorithms. A good start for this new round. ðŸ˜Š

 **Thoughts:** A difficult day. Feeling a bit better.
