# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 3

The log of my #100DaysOfCode - Round 3 challenge. Started on [Tuesday August 4th, 2020].

## Log

### Day 1: August 4, 2020 (Starting a new round - shortest_paths.py)

**Today's Progress**: I'm doing a 3rd round of this challenge to finish the UCSD DSA specialization.
Today it was the second class of CS50x. It was a good way to solidify my CS knowledge.
I also found a big bug in my shortest_path.py code. Tomorrow I will debug it. :)

**Thoughts:** Feeling good besides being kind of a stressful day.

### Day 0: August 5, 2020 (A break)

**Today's Progress**: I got the job! :D I'm taking a break from the challenge today to celebrate a little bit my new job. Because of that, I won't consider yesterday as the first day of the 3rd round.

**Thoughts:** Feeling exited.

### Day 1: August 6, 2020 (Minimum Spanning Tree)

 **Today's Progress**: I learned about MST in graphs and two implementations. Kruskalâ€™s and Primâ€™s algorithms. A good start for this new round. ðŸ˜Š

 **Thoughts:** A difficult day. Feeling a bit better.

### Day 2: August 7, 2020 (Reading)

**Today's Progress**: Reading the book for a deep understanding of the MST lesson. I also started to solve the problem of finding the MST of a set of points given just its x and y coordinates. I'm weighting Kruskal's or Prim's algorithms running time in this special case.

**Thoughts:** Feeling ok. Nothing too bad, nothing too god.

### Day 3: August 8, 2020 (Coding connecting_points.py)

**Today's Progress**: Kind of stuck in small details. I'll work harder.

**Thoughts:** Feeling ok. A little bit overwhelmed.

### Day 4: August 9, 2020 (connecting_points.py :heavy_check_mark: )

**Today's Progress**: After a hectic day I finished coding my problem with a clearest mind. Surprisingly, it passes the grader tests in the first try.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good :smile:.

### Day 5: August 10, 2020 (Thinking clustering.py)

**Today's Progress**: Analyzing how to approach the problem of clustering. It seems that using Kruskal's algorithm is the easiest way to do it.

**Thoughts:** I have plenty of things to do. This weekend may get entertain. Feeling fine.  

### Day 6: August 11, 2020 (Finish coding and start debugging)

**Today's Progress**: After implementing my idea from yesterday I come across expected bugs. I don't know where this last bug is yet, but I have a pretty good idea for finding it tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** 1st day at this job and I still can't believe I'm in. Things are looking pretty good. Tomorrow it'll be my first meeting in English with my team. Feeling exited and nervous. D:

### Day 7: August 12, 2020 (clustering.py :heavy_check_mark:)

**Today's Progress**: I found the bug (and some others alongside that one), I fix them and I submit the code to get a great score. :)
Starting next last and optional week in the course. I need to organized to finish it before I get the financial aid for the next course and also finished the homework for the CS50x class. Feeling the pressure. D:

**Thoughts:** A tiring day. I have to keep going. There are only two days of to the weekend. Feeling tired.

### Day 8: August 13, 2020 (CS50x - Problem set 0 - Scratch)

**Today's Progress**: Starting with my scratch project. I have to manage my expectations before it goes out of control and wanted to code a new super videogame. So far doing well.

**Thoughts:** Mix feelings. Job is doing good, couple not that much, neither family. Feeling fine. I'm going to bed early.

### Day 9: August 14, 2020 (CS50x - Problem set 0 - Scratch :heavy_check_mark: )

**Today's Progress**: Finished the little little game. It looks good and it has room for improvement, but I think that due to my time limitations I will just let it there as it is for now. I may take the time to improve it later on.

**Thoughts:** Kind of heavy day. A good day overall, though. Feeling fine.

### Day 10: August 15, 2020 (CS50x - Problem set 1 - 2/3 :heavy_check_mark:)

**Today's Progress**: I finished the first 2/3 exercises of the problem set 1. 2 introductory problems that I think give a very good base knowledge of the C programing language.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good. Not the super active and productive day, but it is my weekend so I'm just enjoying it (while, of course, coding at least one hour).

### Day 11: August 16, 2020 (CS50x - Problem set 1 - 3/3 :heavy_check_mark:)

**Today's Progress**: Code the last problem for the week 1 in C. I though it was gonna take much less time, but I wasn't at my top performance so it was expected.

**Thoughts:** Not my best day. I pass the day, though. Feeling a little bad.

### Day 12: August 17, 2020 (Bidirectional Dijkstra and A* algorithms)

**Today's Progress**: I'm finding this topic particularly hard. Dijkstra's algorithm already wasn't the easiest thing I've learned and this two are built on top of that. I'm a bit worry for not being able to understand well this algorithms.

**Thoughts:** A hard day. Work is going well, family same, couple not much and me... I've had had better days. Feeling bad.

### Day 13: August 18, 2020 (Contraction Hierarchies)

**Today's Progress**: This advanced shortest paths subject is being pretty complicated. I'm having a hard time understanding these algorithms and theirs implementations. May be when coding them I got illuminated.

**Thoughts:** Having a hard time. I think it is because of the stress cause by the fears of not being up to the new job I have gotten. I don't feel prepare and I'm scare. Feeling down.

### Day 14: August 19, 2020 (Contraction Hierarchies)

**Today's Progress**: I don't understand.

**Thoughts:** Nice day at work, not that great at home. Feeling even more down.

### Day 15: August 20, 2020 (Finally understanding)

**Today's Progress**: Computerphile YouTube channel was my hero! Thanks Dr. Mike Pound! I'm finally understanding how Dijkstra's and A* algorithms. I think now I just need to review the videos (or just the slides) of the course to learn the implementation and may be even the proves of the algorithms, but one step at a time before I get crazy.

**Thoughts:** A nice day overall (even though, my dog wasn't behaving well :sweat:). Feeling better thanks to my advance in my job, the nice resolution of a problem with a client, new bikes I get to see and meeting with a friend after a long time. Of course also because I'm moving on in the DSA course.

### Day 16: August 21, 2020 (MIT OpenCourseWare)

**Today's Progress**: I watch (and take giant notes) a MIT class from professor Srini Devadas on Speeding up Dijkstra where he explains bidirectional Dijkstra, the notion of potential functions for modified weights and how the landmarks come as a application of the latest. Awesome explanation that really helped me understand what I couldn't in my main UCSD DSA course.

**Thoughts:** Life is going up and down and it is a constant fight to keep it balance. It is very hard sometimes, but I'm still here. I thing is how life is supposed to be. Feeling fine.

### Day 17: August 22, 2020 (Playing with more MIT classes)

**Today's Progress**: Watching more classes and trying to start solving the coding problem of bidirectional Dijkstra.

**Thoughts:** A very tiring and productive day. Feeling good.

### Day 18: August 23, 2020 (Coding bidirectional Dijkstra)

**Today's Progress**: It is being challenging. Most because of I'm trying to make sense of the starting code I was provided with. Usually, if I have the algorithm clear I just ignored the hints and code it my way. This time, however, I think it would be easy if I just attach to the guidelines. Moreover because I had problems understanding it. I'm moving at an slow pace.

**Thoughts:** Feeling ok. Not a great, neither a bad day. The greatest, Bayern won the champions; the worst, I couldn't fix the laptop yet, neither finish all my plans. They certainty weren't few. Something went wrong that I ended up with this many pending tasks for my weekend. It may've been the unexpected breaking of my mom's laptop. I still have some time between work and my coding hour, I think.

### Day 19: August 24, 2020 (Actually coding bidirectional Dijkstra)

**Today's Progress**: I'm considering ignoring the hints now that I think I understand better how the algorithm works. It may take longer to understand how to use those hints than actually coding the solution.

**Thoughts:** Feeling well. It was a balanced day. Nothing too high, neither too low. Tired at evening I fell asleep and wake up to finished some tasks and my coding hour.

### Day 20: August 25, 2020 (Still coding bidirectional Dijkstra)

**Today's Progress**: Making huge progress in the code. I'm missing the part for finding the node x where the value of df(x) + db(x) is minimum or finding the shortest path.

**Thoughts:** A good day overall. A bad morning lead me to have a difficult day at work, but nothing too crazy. Tomorrow I'll have several hours to finish all the pending tasks.

### Day 21: August 26, 2020 (Finishing up bidirectional Dijkstra)

**Today's Progress**: I finished the code and it worked at the first try, but it had something that make it too slow for one test so I tried to improve it. While doing so I broke it and now I'm debugging it ^^u.

**Thoughts:** A good day. Tiring, full of activities and nothing bad happening. Feeling ok.

### Day 22: August 27, 2020 (Bidirectional Dijkstra :heavy_check_mark: )

**Today's Progress**: After debugging and reading for solutions on the forums of the course I've finished optimizing my code and it passed the test. I also started with the next course, Algorithms on Strings. I think I'll leave these extra part on graph for another time. My priority now is finishing this course.

**Thoughts:** A terrible day at work. I hope it doesn't have that bad consequences.

### Day 23: August 28, 2020 (Playing around with bash)

**Today's Progress**: Playing with bash on the WSL following The Missing Semester of Your CS Education. The fact they're using Linux laptops and are teaching bash in 2020 brought back my thoughts of switching to Linux on my laptop. I've tried it and force me to use it for some tasks, but never installed on my main computer. Why not living in between both worlds?

**Thoughts:** A better day at work. I did some progress on that task that seem unreachable, but I feel that it is not enough. Well see on Monday.

### Day 24: August 29, 2020 (Tries)

**Today's Progress**: I learned about tries in pattern matching on strings. Complex and interesting stuff.

**Thoughts:** Feeling fine. Not an excellent day, but I'm still alive so it's ok.

### Day 25: August 30, 2020 (vim)

**Today's Progress**: Couldn't focus on the main readings on tries, neither the coding assignments. That's why I just ended up watching the lecture 3 of the missing semester on vim. It's kind of relaxing.

**Thoughts:** A difficult day. Not that bad as other, though. Feeling a little bad.

### Day 26: August 31, 2020 (Coding trie)

**Today's Progress**: I was complicating my life too much when planning the code. Now I have an simple implementation idea. I know I'll work.

**Thoughts:** Feeling confident and good (again). Life is hard, but now I love it. Ha! Feeling good.

### Day 27: September 1st, 2020 (Making the code work)

**Today's Progress**: I though I'd be easier. Trying to make my code work. It at least run without errors, but  outputting the wrong answer. Debugging it won't be that difficult.

**Thoughts:** I'm also trying to make run for everything in my life. Work, study, home (my room in this case), personal care (working out and nutrition), games, friends, couple and family. It is difficult to keep everything in balance, but I'm going on. Feeling ok.

### Day 28: September 2, 2020 (trie_matching.py)

**Today's Progress**: I made good progress today. I finished debugging yesterday's problem and finished the second one. It was kind of easy.

**Thoughts:** The day felt really short. I couldn't do my exercises. Too much time gaming? I'm finishing kind of early though. It is midnight compare to the 1:00 am when I usually turn off my laptop. Feeling ok.

### Day 29: September 3, 2020 (trie_matching_improved and suffix_tree.)

**Today's Progress**: I finished the next problem with some simple modifications because I already made the firsts pretty general. Now, this next problem, building an space efficient suffix tree is taking me some time. I think may using logarithmic time to find the position where to break the string may be one way. I'm not sure, but I want to go bed early so tomorrow we'll see.

**Thoughts:** Feeling ok. Not my greatest day at job, but I think it'll get better. Hopefully tomorrow is the last day of the week.

### Day 30: September 4, 2020 (Suffix tree)

**Today's Progress**: Thinking and researching before tackling the problem. It seems kind of hard to implement. I didn't come up with the algorithm by myself at that make me feel not so great.

**Thoughts:** A good day at work and at home. I couldn't do my workout, but it's ok. Feeling ok.
