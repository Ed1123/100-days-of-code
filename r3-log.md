The log of my #100DaysOfCode - Round 3 challenge. Started on [Tuesday August 4th, 2020].

## Log

### Day 1: August 4, 2020 (Starting a new round - shortest_paths.py)

**Today's Progress**: I'm doing a 3rd round of this challenge to finish the UCSD DSA specialization.
Today it was the second class of CS50x. It was a good way to solidify my CS knowledge.
I also found a big bug in my shortest_path.py code. Tomorrow I will debug it. :)
 
**Thoughts:** Feeling good besides being kind of a stressful day.
