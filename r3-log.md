# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 3

The log of my #100DaysOfCode - Round 3 challenge. Started on [Tuesday August 4th, 2020].

## Log

### Day 1: August 4, 2020 (Starting a new round - shortest_paths.py)

**Today's Progress**: I'm doing a 3rd round of this challenge to finish the UCSD DSA specialization.
Today it was the second class of CS50x. It was a good way to solidify my CS knowledge.
I also found a big bug in my shortest_path.py code. Tomorrow I will debug it. :)

**Thoughts:** Feeling good besides being kind of a stressful day.

### Day 0: August 5, 2020 (A break)

**Today's Progress**: I got the job! :D I'm taking a break from the challenge today to celebrate a little bit my new job. Because of that, I won't consider yesterday as the first day of the 3rd round.

**Thoughts:** Feeling exited.

### Day 1: August 6, 2020 (Minimum Spanning Tree)

 **Today's Progress**: I learned about MST in graphs and two implementations. Kruskalâ€™s and Primâ€™s algorithms. A good start for this new round. ðŸ˜Š

 **Thoughts:** A difficult day. Feeling a bit better.

### Day 2: August 7, 2020 (Reading)

**Today's Progress**: Reading the book for a deep understanding of the MST lesson. I also started to solve the problem of finding the MST of a set of points given just its x and y coordinates. I'm weighting Kruskal's or Prim's algorithms running time in this special case.

**Thoughts:** Feeling ok. Nothing too bad, nothing too god.

### Day 3: August 8, 2020 (Coding connecting_points.py)

**Today's Progress**: Kind of stuck in small details. I'll work harder.

**Thoughts:** Feeling ok. A little bit overwhelmed.

### Day 4: August 9, 2020 (connecting_points.py :heavy_check_mark: )

**Today's Progress**: After a hectic day I finished coding my problem with a clearest mind. Surprisingly, it passes the grader tests in the first try.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good :smile:.

### Day 5: August 10, 2020 (Thinking clustering.py)

**Today's Progress**: Analyzing how to approach the problem of clustering. It seems that using Kruskal's algorithm is the easiest way to do it.

**Thoughts:** I have plenty of things to do. This weekend may get entertain. Feeling fine.  

### Day 6: August 11, 2020 (Finish coding and start debugging)

**Today's Progress**: After implementing my idea from yesterday I come across expected bugs. I don't know where this last bug is yet, but I have a pretty good idea for finding it tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** 1st day at this job and I still can't believe I'm in. Things are looking pretty good. Tomorrow it'll be my first meeting in English with my team. Feeling exited and nervous. D:

### Day 7: August 12, 2020 (clustering.py :heavy_check_mark:)

**Today's Progress**: I found the bug (and some others alongside that one), I fix them and I submit the code to get a great score. :)
Starting next last and optional week in the course. I need to organized to finish it before I get the financial aid for the next course and also finished the homework for the CS50x class. Feeling the pressure. D:

**Thoughts:** A tiring day. I have to keep going. There are only two days of to the weekend. Feeling tired.

### Day 8: August 13, 2020 (CS50x - Problem set 0 - Scratch)

**Today's Progress**: Starting with my scratch project. I have to manage my expectations before it goes out of control and wanted to code a new super videogame. So far doing well.

**Thoughts:** Mix feelings. Job is doing good, couple not that much, neither family. Feeling fine. I'm going to bed early.

### Day 9: August 14, 2020 (CS50x - Problem set 0 - Scratch :heavy_check_mark: )

**Today's Progress**: Finished the little little game. It looks good and it has room for improvement, but I think that due to my time limitations I will just let it there as it is for now. I may take the time to improve it later on.

**Thoughts:** Kind of heavy day. A good day overall, though. Feeling fine.

### Day 10: August 15, 2020 (CS50x - Problem set 1 - 2/3 :heavy_check_mark:)

**Today's Progress**: I finished the first 2/3 exercises of the problem set 1. 2 introductory problems that I think give a very good base knowledge of the C programing language.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good. Not the super active and productive day, but it is my weekend so I'm just enjoying it (while, of course, coding at least one hour).

### Day 11: August 16, 2020 (CS50x - Problem set 1 - 3/3 :heavy_check_mark:)

**Today's Progress**: Code the last problem for the week 1 in C. I though it was gonna take much less time, but I wasn't at my top performance so it was expected.

**Thoughts:** Not my best day. I pass the day, though. Feeling a little bad.

### Day 12: August 17, 2020 (Bidirectional Dijkstra and A* algorithms)

**Today's Progress**: I'm finding this topic particularly hard. Dijkstra's algorithm already wasn't the easiest thing I've learned and this two are built on top of that. I'm a bit worry for not being able to understand well this algorithms.

**Thoughts:** A hard day. Work is going well, family same, couple not much and me... I've had had better days. Feeling bad.

### Day 13: August 18, 2020 (Contraction Hierarchies)

**Today's Progress**: This advanced shortest paths subject is being pretty complicated. I'm having a hard time understanding these algorithms and theirs implementations. May be when coding them I got illuminated.

**Thoughts:** Having a hard time. I think it is because of the stress cause by the fears of not being up to the new job I have gotten. I don't feel prepare and I'm scare. Feeling down.

### Day 14: August 19, 2020 (Contraction Hierarchies)

**Today's Progress**: I don't understand.

**Thoughts:** Nice day at work, not that great at home. Feeling even more down.

### Day 15: August 20, 2020 (Finally understanding)

**Today's Progress**: Computerphile YouTube channel was my hero! Thanks Dr. Mike Pound! I'm finally understanding how Dijkstra's and A* algorithms. I think now I just need to review the videos (or just the slides) of the course to learn the implementation and may be even the proves of the algorithms, but one step at a time before I get crazy.

**Thoughts:** A nice day overall (even though, my dog wasn't behaving well :sweat:). Feeling better thanks to my advance in my job, the nice resolution of a problem with a client, new bikes I get to see and meeting with a friend after a long time. Of course also because I'm moving on in the DSA course.
