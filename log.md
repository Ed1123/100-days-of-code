# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 14, 2020 (-to complete-)

**Today's Progress**: Javascript for sending a message automaticaly when someone starts tying on Whatsapp web. Review Github, how to fork and work with it.

**Thoughts:** It was difficult to start. A little bit worried about the future, but it doesn't happend yet so I'll be focusing on the present. This'll be great. Here I go, Google.

### Day 1: January 15, 2020 (WhatsappWeb send when typing)

**Today's Progress**: I worked in yesterday's code improving it with online sources. I learned more about web, but it is definitely not my strenght. I also commit the code to Github and add a little game I did some time ago to improve it as a part of this challege.

**Thoughts:** Feeling great with a lot of energy to keep working on this. A little bit nervous about the problems it may have in the future, but it's manageble.

### Day 2: January 16, 2020 ()

**Today's Progress**: Some improvements to the Whatsapp autosend and the random number game. Also investigate and plan on how to run the python code online. For now the workaround is Trinket.io. I'll have my own webapp for that soon.

**Thoughts:** I'm amazed by how well the code was on the random number game and the fact that I did it a long time ago just by myself. Point for me there.
Days seems to be passing slowly, but I know I will keep on the challenge. Today was a tired day. At least I manage to keep on the challenge. Let's sleep now.

### Day 3: January 17, 2020 (Learning Django)

**Today's Progress**: Install Django, read about packages, read and try to poll app in the Django tutorial web.

**Thoughts:** What a day. I struggle to start today but at least I spend some time on coding. Feeling a little bit down.


### Day 4: January 18, 2020 (Django vs Flask)

**Today's Progress**: Very little really. I learn the differences between Flask and Django. I run both "Hello World" webapps. For now I think I'll put apart Django and learn Flask for its simplicity. Tomorrow I'll start learning Flask. I planned that for the end of the next week I'll have my own webapp.

**Thoughts:** It was a day full of activities. I manage to be on top of then and controll all the situations. Now its time to sleep. I'm really tired.
