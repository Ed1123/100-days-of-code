# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 14, 2020 (-to complete-)

**Today's Progress**: Javascript for sending a message automaticaly when someone starts tying on Whatsapp web. Review Github, how to fork and work with it.

**Thoughts:** It was difficult to start. A little bit worried about the future, but it doesn't happend yet so I'll be focusing on the present. This'll be great. Here I go, Google.

### Day 1: January 15, 2020 (WhatsappWeb send when typing)

**Today's Progress**: I worked in yesterday's code improving it with online sources. I learned more about web, but it is definitely not my strenght. I also commit the code to Github and add a little game I did some time ago to it as a part of this challege.

**Thoughts:** Feeling great with a lot of energy to keep working on this. A little bit nervous about the problems it may have in the future, but it's manageble.

### Day 2: January 16, 2020 ()

**Today's Progress**: Some improvements to the Whatsapp autosend and the random number game. Also investigate and plan on how to run the python code online. For now the workaround is Trinket.io. I'll have my own webapp for that soon.

**Thoughts:** I'm amazed by how well the code was on the random number game and the fact that I did it a long time ago just by myself. Point for me there.
Days seems to be passing slowly, but I know I will keep on the challenge. Today was a tired day. At least I manage to keep on the challenge. Let's sleep now.

### Day 3: January 17, 2020 (Learning Django)

**Today's Progress**: Install Django, read about packages, read and try to poll app in the Django tutorial web.

**Thoughts:** What a day. I struggle to start today but at least I spend some time on coding. Feeling a little bit down.


### Day 4: January 18, 2020 (Django vs Flask)

**Today's Progress**: Very little really. I learn the differences between Flask and Django. I run both "Hello World" webapps. For now I think I'll put apart Django and learn Flask for its simplicity. Tomorrow I'll start learning Flask. I planned that for the end of the next week I'll have my own webapp.

**Thoughts:** It was a day full of activities. I manage to be on top of then and controll all the situations. Now its time to sleep. I'm really tired.

**Link to work:** [There is no link for today](http://www.example.com)


### Day 5: January 19, 2020 (Troubleshooting)

**Today's Progress**: I spend most of the time troubleshooting. I found the Flask tutorial by freeCodeAcademy.org on YouTube but I couldn't finished it yet for the problems I was facing. At least now I know about virtual enviroments, problems with Windows Store Python and decided to use VSCode alonside with Notepad++. Sublime is pretty good, but I can't allow me to spend on it just yet.

**Thoughts:** Long day with some negative thoughts for the problem after problem I faced. At least they didn't last longer. Tomorrow will be a different story.


### Day 6: January 20, 2020 (Starting with Flask)

**Today's Progress**: Continue with the Flask tutorial. I like that it's really fast. I like that challenge, but that also means that I have to pause a lot to read and understant what I'm doing. That 46 minutes tutorial will be a couple of chapters for me ^^u. With all of that I like it.

**Thoughts:** A hard day at work. It draind almost all my energy. My mind didn't help that much neither. Fortunately, I manage to move at least a little bit in my coding path.


### Day 7: January 21, 2020 (Bah)

**Today's Progress**: The Flaks project seems too much. At least for today I couldn't finish it. On the other hand, I learn about Linux ownership and permissions (chown and chmod), install pyinstaller to be able to compile python into executables and learn about 4 types of hosting (self hosting, traditional, free and VPS (cloud?)).

**Thoughts:** What a day. The most down day in a lot of time. The extra things I had to do for work may be the reason.


### Day 8: January 22, 2020 (Not prepare YET. Still recovering.)

**Today's Progress**: I did some researsh on Python and came up to the conclusion that I'm not prepare for learning frameworks like Django or Flask yet. First, I need to master Data Structures and Algorithms. I found many free (and payed) courses online. I toke a glance at some of them and narrow my alternatives down to 3. Tomorrow I'll start with any of those. Now I want to sleep.

**Thoughts:** Still recovering from yesterday terrible day. I feel tired today and couldn't move that much. At least I did my yoga and do some researsh.


### Day 9: January 23, 2020 (Much better. Data Structures and Algoriths)

**Today's Progress**: After a little lot thinking on where to start I finally started with a 6-months coursera specialization, Data Structures and Algorithms. I just started it and so far I looks awesome. I reviewed also a little bit of discrete math, which basics are needed for the course. I think I've learned in college, but not with that name.

**Thoughts:** I feel better with the help of my love. Day was a bit hard and with few time (it's 1:24am right now), but now everything seems ok.


### Day 10: January 24, 2020 (Discrete Maths and Data Structures and Algoriths)

**Today's Progress**: Review some discrete maths concepts and move on the course. I now know what is a stress test. Tomorrow I will implement it.

**Thoughts:** Day full of activities (battery, psy, Ayr). It was a great day. I'm feeling full of energies. I'd make more hours of code, but I need to rest.


### Day 11: January 25, 2020 (Fibbonaci)

**Today's Progress**: Learn to stress test and probe an algorithm works for many cases. Also review the Fibbonaci series and how it grows more quickly than 2^(n/2) (demostrated by induction) The course is getting pretty academic. I love it!

**Thoughts:** Another great day. I feel a little worried for the time not being enough for my codeing hour. Well, it's 1:24 am ._.


### Day 12: January 26, 2020 (Big-O)

**Today's Progress**: Algorithms efficiency and Big-O notation. I dive into the math part of Big-O notation. I'm really liking how technically this course allow me to be.

**Thoughts:** A sunday. I wanted to rest, but I also want to study. At the end I gave a little bit more than an hour to studying. :)


### Day 13: January 27, 2020 (Big-Theta)

**Today's Progress**: Big-theta. I spend the hole hour demostrating Big-Theta of a geometrical series. Amazing and tyring.

**Thoughts:** Something unconfortable at home change my mood. A little bit down... again.


### Day 14: January 28, 2020 (Fibonacci proves)

**Today's Progress**: Trying some Fibonacci proves. I couldn't make it.

**Thoughts:** I don't remember. I think I was better than yesterday.


### Day 15: January 29, 2020 (Fibonacci proves... again)

**Today's Progress**: I found the proves I couldn't find yesterfay.

**Thoughts:** I feel... ok. Not bad, not good. I felt great after finding the solutions I couldn't do myself yesterdey.



### Day 16: January 30, 2020 (Google Cloud Platform / Matrixes for Fibonacci)

**Today's Progress**: Signed up for GCP (free $300 for a year) and set up a virtual server. I think I'll be hosting something simple there soon. I also reviewed the algorithms book's missing exercises. I have an idea for all of them but the last. Tomorrow I will write them down and continue with the next chapter in the course.

**Thoughts:** Feeling tired from yesterday, but I found energy to study.


### Day 17: January 31, 2020 (Euclidean Algorithm)

**Today's Progress**: Euclidean Algorithm. I did it on nano. Pretty good. :)

**Thoughts:** Feeling really tired for not sleeping well this last two days.


### Day 18: February 01, 2020 (Problem solving and reading)

**Today's Progress**: Discuss an elegant way to prove the number of matrices multiplications. Read a little bit more about the Euclid's algorithm. And also make a little program that prints Fib numbers (the algorithm that uses an array) to visualize it and explain it. Now I have my screen filled with a fib number. ^^u

**Thoughts:** It was a great day. I have a great time with my special one :).


### Day 19: February 02, 2020 (Reviewing Asimptotic Notation)

**Today's Progress**: Review aimptotic notation in the course. It's the last part of the second week of it. I also learn some Jupiter and how to use the python's numpy and matplotlib libraries.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good, a little tired and the beggining but good after all. Today I finish early. It's 9pm. :D


### Day 20: February 03, 2020 (Quizes and first real assigment)

**Today's Progress**: I did some quizes and solve the first problem of my first real assigment. Still basic algorithms.

**Thoughts:** It was a good day meeting an old friend after a long time. It's good to have good friends supporting you. :)


### Day 21: February 04, 2020 (fibonacci_last_digit.py)

**Today's Progress**: Learn to plot histograms with Pandas. Also finish the second assignment of 8 I have to do. I think I need to speed things up, but I’m really enjoying learning each one very well and understanding everything. It has always paid me back. 

**Thoughts:** Kind of a sluggish day. It wasn't that bad at the end.

### Day 22: February 05, 2020 (gcd.py & lcm.py)

**Today's Progress**: Program to calculate gcd efficiently. I did it in advance so I just had to adapt it. Program to calculate the lcm. My gcd program helped me with that. I stress test both to become more familiar with testing. Also I have the code for fibonacci_huge.py almost complete.

**Thoughts:** What a day at work. I was falling asleep every half and hour. The office was terribly hot. That may be the reason. At last my code entertain me a lot.


### Day 23: February 06, 2020 (fibonacci_huge.py)

**Today's Progress**: As I got inscrived in the course I started sending my past assignments (and correcting those first 2 I thought were ready). Also finish the 5th of the 8 assignments of the Week 2 of the course, the fibonacci_huge! :D. 

**Thoughts:** Bguag day... Although, it had a good new at the end. I get financial aid for the course I’m in right now.

**Link to work:** [Tweet with screenshot](https://twitter.com/iEdMV/status/1225647848546418689)


### Day 24: February 07, 2020 (3 x Last digit of the sum of Fibonacci numbers)

**Today's Progress**: Finist the homework! And all was correct 8/8. Last digit of the sum of Fibonacci numbers, last digit of the partial sum, last digit of the sum of the squares :D. Also started with the week 3, greedy algorithms.

**Thoughts:** I started the day with more energy than yesterday. Maybe looking at one  of my passions, video games, helps me find an intention for the day.

**Link to work:** [Tweet with screenshot](https://twitter.com/iEdMV/status/1225978853161611264)


### Day 25: February 08, 2020 (Greedy Algorithm)

**Today's Progress**: Continue with Greedy Algorithms. Learn its basic principles. I also read about partitions to understand part of a problem. I didn’t know them till now. Pretty appealing math stuff.

**Thoughts:** A better day. It's the weekend and I managed my free time pretty well. I didn’t want to study much today so I limited my practice to just a little bit more than an hour. Feeling good.


### Day 26: February 09, 2020 (Greedy Algorithm)

**Today's Progress**: I finished greedy algorithms theory lessons and review the next assignment.

**Thoughts:** Another “neh” day. I didn’t manage to finish all my activities early… That makes me feel bad. Also, today I didn’t like doing anything, but I did much.., whatever...


### Day 27: February 10, 2020 (Money change problem)

**Today's Progress**: I did the first problem of my assignment and test it (I didn't stress test it though), Money change. Also understand sys module in Python. Finally, I got some work in advance for the next problem.
 
**Thoughts:** A hard day. My laptop didn't turn on when I got home and that make me feel sad. I just wanted to sleep after that and that's what I did.


### Day 28: February 11, 2020 (Fractional Knapsack)

**Today's Progress**: I finished my Fractional Knapsack problem. 2/7 ready. I couldn't find more time at work to do more.

**Thoughts:** A better day. Some troubles with time, but manageable. The night was better playing with my cousin.


### Day 29: February 12, 2020 (Car refill)

**Today's Progress**: At least advance a bit with the solution of the car refill problem. Also review some Linux installations docs.

**Thoughts:** No words.


### Day 30: February 13, 2020 (Car refill)

**Today's Progress**: Having trouble with the car refill algorithm implementation. Perfectionism played against me.

**Thoughts:** The clouds dissipated during the day and the day got better by evening. Did anyone notice the pattern?



### Day 31: February 14, 2020 (Car refill - second)

**Today's Progress**: I've made one program that seems to work. I was working on another algorithm to prove the first (also because I want something made just by me).

**Thoughts:** Normal day. Kind of late (1:38am) to code, but it's ok now.


### Day 32: February 16, 2020 (Car refill done!)

**Today's Progress**: Finished understanding, debugging and testing the car refill problem. It took much more than expected, but it’s ok. I feel that I’ve learned it pretty well. Also started with the next problem. Permutations?

**Thoughts:** I miss one day, but it was planned. It was ok. It’s like I take a single day of on this journey. Feeling tired but relaxed.


### Day 33: February 17, 2020 (Max for product)

**Today's Progress**: Finished the max product problem. I just need to finish debugging the stress test.

**Thoughts:** A little bit hard day at work. Downing thoughts everywhere xD.


### Day 34: February 18, 2020 (Debugging dot product)

**Today's Progress**: They certainly are permutations. I’ve already solved the problem, but I want to test it with a naive algorithm finding all possible solutions and just comparing them. It’ll be naive and just for testing purposes.

**Thoughts:** A productive day. I recovered my laptop and some confidence in the process. Feeling ok. Need to move from this stuck place I'm in.


### Day 35: February 19, 2020 (Finished the dot product!)

**Today's Progress**: Finish the dot product problem. It took me longer than I would have liked. Also started with the collecting signatures problem. So far I have two tasks here. Come up with an algorithm and read about tuples for understanding how the initial code in the program is using them.

**Thoughts:** Feeling a bit more than ok. I just need to accommodate my schedule and do a bit more exercise.


### Day 36: February 20, 2020 (Finished the algorithm and safe move prove)

**Today's Progress**: I did it! Covering segments it’s partially done. I just need to learn about named tuples in python and how to order them.

**Thoughts:** A haaaaaaaaaaaaaard working day. I feel fine though. I feel that I’m been useful.


### Day 37: February 21, 2020 (different summands)

**Today's Progress**: Finish testing the collecting signatures problem. Also finish the different summands, but I think my algorithm is a by too slow. Tomorrow I’ll check it. Update: I couldn’t wait till tomorrow. The algorithm is fast. The naive algorithm was the slow part when stress testing.

**Thoughts:** A high day. I can eat the world.


### Day 38: February 22, 2020 (last exercise)

**Today's Progress**: I finish the last greedy algorithm exercise. It was great. Tomorrow, divide and conquer.

**Thoughts:** F… I have to organize better. It’s 2:07 am.


### Day 39: February 23, 2020 (Divide and Conquer)

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to Divide and Conquer algorithms. Review linear search and binary search. Also review polynomial multiplication.

**Thoughts:** A better day but starting to feel down again.


### Day 40: February 24, 2020 (Divide and Conquer)

**Today's Progress**: Polynomial multiplication understood. Also learned how Gauss's trick helps reduce the leaves of the recursion tree when using the divide and conquer algorithm.

**Thoughts:** A productive day at work doing some Python code with pandas and excel and csv files. Those kinds of tasks always cheers me up.


### Day 41: February 25, 2020 (Master theorem)

**Today's Progress**: Studied the master theorem in depth. It helps a lot to understand better how divide and conquer trees and its recursive times work.

**Thoughts:** More python at work! I’ve got some more interesting work for tomorrow. Though, today was a really really tiring day.


### Day 42: February 26, 2020 (Sorting)

**Today's Progress**: Learned selection sort, merge sort and counting sort. Not only the algorithms, but also its running time en big-O notation. Also learned that comparison based sorting do at best nlogn, but that if we know details about the sorting array it can be done better using non-comparison based algorithms.

**Thoughts:** Another tiring day at work. Full of python. I love it, but I get tired.


### Day 43: February 27, 2020 (Quick sort)

**Today's Progress**: Learned the quick sort algorithm. A long lesson.

**Thoughts:** What a day. I just feel really sleepy because I couldn’t sleep well for my allergy.


### Day 44: February 28, 2020 (Quick sort)

**Today's Progress**: Still with quick sort. Analice it’s running time using probabilities. Also learned new implementation to reduce space occupation, using a random pivot to avoid worst cases and partitioning in three parts to operate in nlogn with “few unique” arrays.

**Thoughts:** Tough day at work. Feel a bit tentious for a client that was unhappy with its computer (after 3 months), but everything ended up going well. (not in my relation, but...well…)


### Day 45: February 29, 2020 (Divide and conquer assignments)

**Today's Progress**: Implement the binary search algorithm in python. Also tried to solve the problem of finding a majority element in an array in O(n logn). No success yet.

**Thoughts:** Productive day at home. I did some tasks I was procrastinating.


### Day 46: March 01, 2020 (Majority element)

**Today's Progress**: Stuck in the problem, but I got a little illumination at the end of the day.

**Thoughts:** Another productive day at home. I also receive a good new. I hope everything goes as planned.


### Day 47: March 02, 2020 (Majority element)

**Today's Progress**: The illumination seemed to work and it did for some cases. Stress testing showed me that it didn’t for all.

**Thoughts:** An exciting day for the opportunity that appeared in front of me. I just have to take it easy.


### Day 48: March 03, 2020 (PL/SQL)

**Today's Progress**: Read the basics of PL/SQL. Functions, procedures, triggers, cursors and exceptions.

**Thoughts:** Day full of reading new information. I felt exited. I hope things go well.


### Day 49: March 04, 2020 (Improved quick sort)

**Today's Progress**: Solve the problem of implementing an improvement for the quick sort algorithm to work efficiently with few-unique-elements arrays.

**Thoughts:** The interview went well! I hope I’ll get the job. If not, my plan B will be triggered.


### Day 50: March 05, 2020 (Number of invertions)

**Today's Progress**: This divide and conquer algoths are taking me longer than expected. Implement and debugging a solution for getting the number of inversions of an array.

**Thoughts:** It seems I will. I’m excited.


### Day 51: March 06, 2020 (Get number of inversions solved!)

**Today's Progress**: Finally get the algorithm to work properly. The next problem is Organizing a Lottery. I have a naive solution in mind for tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** They haven’t called me yet and that made me a bit anxious today. I manage to maintain a positive attitude, though.

**Link to work:** [Tweet with screenshot](https://twitter.com/iEdMV/status/1236112768509632512)


### Day 52: March 07, 2020 (Organizing a lottery)

**Today's Progress**: The naive solution was already done. I don’t have a clue on how to proceed with the divide and conquer one. I also tried again the majority element algorithm.

**Thoughts:** Awesome day. I bought my new monitor and told everyone about the new job.


### Day 53: March 08, 2020 (Majority element and Organizing a lottery)

**Today's Progress**: Majority element solved after a limitation on the algorithm. The final code is so neat that I’m impressed on how I was managing to complicate the problem that much. Also tried again to find a solution for the Organizing a lottery problem, but I couldn’t find any yet.

**Thoughts:** Feeling confident. I expect the call for tomorrow.


### Day 54: March 09, 2020 (Organizing a lottery)

**Today's Progress**: Contemplating possible solutions for the problem. I haven’t found any yet.

**Thoughts:** Still feeling good. Mantining me active gives me always a good mood (I believe). 


### Day 55: March 10, 2020 (Closest Points)

**Today's Progress**: Having trouble with this last two problems. I finsihed the naive algorith for the Closest Points problem. Also reviewed the needed concepts to solve it in O(n Log^2(n)).

**Thoughts:** Didn’t feel that right today. It’s enough to say it’s 2:18 am already.


### Day 56: March 11, 2020 (Dynamic programing)

**Today's Progress**: Left divide and conquer for today. I started the next chapter Dynamic programming.

**Thoughts:** Another slow day.


### Day 57: March 12, 2020 (Dynamic programing - Alignment string)

**Today's Progress**: I learned basic dynamic programming concepts and the problem of alignment string and its variations.

**Thoughts:** Boring day at work. Feeling a bit better, but still not at my 100%.


### Day 58: March 13, 2020 (Dynamic programing - Edit distance)

**Today's Progress**: Reading technical stuff from books to better understand the underlying details.

**Thoughts:** A slow day, but I think it’s about to end.

**Link to work:** [Tweet with screenshot](https://twitter.com/iEdMV/status/1238702985091469312)


### Day 59: March 14, 2020 (Dynamic programing - DNA)

**Today's Progress**: Still reading. It's good for key concepts.

**Thoughts:** A better day, very productive. Still feeling a little sluggish, but better overall.


### Day 60: March 15, 2020 (Dynamic programing - Hirschber's algorithm)

**Today's Progress**: Trying to understand Hirschber's algorithm, reading most advanced stuff and gave a glance to the assignment problem.

**Thoughts:** A sunday. Still not feeling in the mood to try those algorithms exercises from the divide and conquer seccion I left.


### Day 61: March 16, 2020 (Dynamic programing - Money change)

**Today's Progress**: Read an awesome article that encourages me in this difficult time. Also started with the Money change problem with DP. I’ve already implemented a recursive solution just for the stress test.

**Thoughts:** Feeling ok. I didn’t have a lot of energy to move in my coding journey (work and the circumstances take most of it), but an article helped me keep moving on.


### Day 62: March 17, 2020 (Dynamic programing - Money change, Primitive calculator)

**Today's Progress**: Finish implementing a dp solution for the money change problem and test it. Also I finished the solution for the primitive calculator problem.

**Thoughts:** Feeling better. I move much more than the last few days. Great.


### Day 63: March 18, 2020 (Dynamic programing - Edit distance, Longest common subsequence)

**Today's Progress**: Today I solved the Edit distance problem, from implementing the algorithm to stress testing it. I also give a glance to the next problem, the Longest common subsequence problem. Besides that I read the book and review my notes.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good. I have to know how to maintain this energy level. A productive day.


### Day 64: March 19, 2020 (Dynamic programing - Longest common subsequence for 2 and 3 sequences)

**Today's Progress**: Today I solved the longest common subsequence problem for 2 and 3 sequences. The first was a modification of the edit distance problem while the later was an adequation of the lcs2. Instead of a 2-dimensional array I had to use a 3-d array. I solved both problems and tested them.

**Thoughts:** A productive day. Nothing to do for work, but since I have the mobility to be at home I was able to do many more things.


### Day 65: March 20, 2020 (Dynamic programing - Reading)

**Today's Progress**: Reading about a structure technique to solve DP problems. One is to analyze the structure of the optimal solution and the other is optimizing a brute force solution.

**Thoughts:** An anxious day without really coding. I managed to complete at least one hour.


### Day 66: March 21, 2020 (Points and segments problem, again)

**Today's Progress**: Return to the points and segments problem, tried an approach and failed without finishing it. Then, after reading the course forum, I found an incredibly simple solution. Tomorrow I’ll implement it.

**Thoughts:** Another anxious day. I managed to move more than yesterday, though.


### Day 67: March 22, 2020 (Points and segments problem, almost done)

**Today's Progress**: Finally, I implement a solution for the points and segments problem. I spend most of the time trying to sort the array of pairs applying my random quick sort algorithm. I face some problems with ordering the array just using the first element. The solution at the end was easier than expected. I already know how to implement the last part. I’m just letting it as a motivation to start coding tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** A slow day. Fortunately, I did the code I wanted to do. And it was more than 1 hour.


### Day 68: March 23, 2020 (Week 4 almost done. 4/6)

**Today's Progress**: I finished implementing a solution for the points and segments problem. I also implemented the algorithm for the closest point problem. Then I submitted the 6 solutions to find out that 2 have errors. For now I can’t find them. Tomorrow I’ll keep looking for them.

**Thoughts:** A day with a lot of code. Unfortunately I didn’t have the results I expected. Tomorrow will be another day to keep trying.


### Day 69: March 24, 2020 (Debugging and started Week 6)

**Today's Progress**: I feel so proud of myself for not giving up in the 2 problems I left from week 4. I completed them and today I finished submitting them, debugging them in the process. Week 4 and Week 5 finish with 100 score. :D

**Thoughts:** A normal day. Some video games and debugging.


### Day 70: March 25, 2020 (Knapsack with and without repetitions using DP)

**Today's Progress**: Review lessons in which the knapsack problem was analyzed. Greedy algorithms don’t work when fractions of items are not allowed because the safe move is indeed not safe.

**Thoughts:** Feeling a little bit down today. The day got better at night, though.


### Day 71: March 26, 2020 (Knapsack without repetitions problems)

**Today's Progress**: I finished the week 6 lessons. Now implementing the solution for this week's assignments. The first is the knapsack problem without repetitions.

**Thoughts:** Feeling more down than yesterday. Moving the minimum.


### Day 72: March 27, 2020 (Knapsack without repetitions debugging)

**Today's Progress**: Finished implementing the algorithm, but I’ve found a bug while stress testing. Seems a silly one while redefining a global variable. It’s enough for today though. Tomorrow will be a new day.

**Thoughts:** Today wasn’t a great day. Hating my neighbors.


### Day 73: March 28, 2020 (Partitioning)

**Today's Progress**: As I was expecting, the bug was very silly and I debugged it right away. Started the second problem, partitioning. I had some trouble figuring out an algorithm, but after a long time thinking I think I have a solution. Tomorrow I’ll implement it.

**Thoughts:** Another down day. It took a long time to get up after feeling down.


### Day 74: March 29, 2020 (Partitioning done, Placing parentheses)

**Today's Progress**: I ended up implementing a cleanest solution for the partitioning problem, but the reasoning which I came up with yesterday was the starting point. I also implement a recursive dynamic programming solution for the placing parentheses problem, the next and last one. Tomorrow I’ll make a bottom up one and test it

**Thoughts:** Another better day overall. At least I put away my watched clothes.


### Day 75: March 30, 2020 (Starting Data Structures Class)

**Today's Progress**: The bottom up solution and the testing took a lot more than expected. I really enjoyed implementing it and learned A LOT, though. With that I finished the Algorithmic Toolbox class. Moving to the next one in the specialization, Data Structures. I hope it is as interesting as this was.

**Thoughts:** A much better day.


### Day 76: March 31, 2020 (Arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues)

**Today's Progress**: Pretty interesting stuff I haven’t seen before. Definitions, algorithms and running times for allowed methods on each data structure.

**Thoughts:** I feel a little lazy today. I took the time I allow me to take and move the most that I can.


### Day 77: April 1, 2020 (Trees!)

**Today's Progress**: Finish reading about trees and the methods for walking trees (DFS and BPS). Also started with the assignment. Also watch a video on being an expert on Python.

**Thoughts:** A bad day.


### Day 78: April 2, 2020 (check_brackets.py)

**Today's Progress**: I implemented a solution for the problem of checking brackets parity on a string. I haven’t performed any tests yet though.

**Thoughts:** A better day, but still a lazy one. At least I move, read and learn a lot of Web Dev.


### Day 79: April 3, 2020 (tree-height.py)

**Today's Progress**: I finished testing the check_brackets.py problem and moved to the tree height one. I spend a lot of time reviewing key concepts. Those help get to a solution. Tomorrow I’ll implement it.

**Thoughts:** Still lazy, but starting to feel better.


### Day 80: April 4, 2020 (tree-height.py)

**Today's Progress**: Messing things up. Understanding trees and how to store them is more complex than I initially thought. I learned about declaring classes in python. I haven’t done it before. I think tomorrow I’ll be enlightened.

**Thoughts:** A better day. Feeling better and better.


### Day 81: April 5, 2020 (tree_height.py)

**Today's Progress**: I was debugging a class and finished implementing a recursive solution for the tree_height problem. It has some problems with recursion limits on python, although I used the indications to avoid them. I was also working on a non-recursive solution using stacks. Tomorrow it’ll be ready.

**Thoughts:** Sunday. I allow myself to rest, but at the same time I take plenty of time to study. Time to go to bed.


### Day 82: April 6, 2020 (process_packages.py)

**Today's Progress**: I finished the tree height problem implemented without recursion. I tested it and submitted it. It was correct. I also started with the process packages problem. I have an idea for the algorithm, but I’m having trouble understanding the initial code with classes that was provided to me. Some interesting stuff to check tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** It was a tiring day for me, but I managed to be productive in my code. I have to move in other areas also. I’ll find a way.


### Day 83: April 7, 2020 (process_packages.py)

**Today's Progress**: After many hours understanding the logic of the problem I have a working algorithm. It failed some of my tests, though. Tomorrow will be debugging time.

**Thoughts:** A productive coding day even though I didn’t feel like coding.


### Day 84: April 8, 2020 (process_packages.py and stack_with_max.py)

**Today's Progress**: I finished debugging the process_packages.py, finally. The next problem was an easy one. Using a stack inside a stack class definition to add a max method that returns the max in constant time and not in O(n). Solved, tested and debugged. Also I started with the next problem, max sliding window. 

**Thoughts:** Another productive coding day. I think I’ve found a technique to move when I’m a bit lazy.


### Day 85: April 9, 2020 (Max sliding window)

**Today's Progress**: The solution I implemented had a problem and I ran out of ideas for today. I’m tired. 

**Thoughts:** A very very tiring day. I feel good for having helped my therapist with a virtual conference. Even though it took most of my energy and I just could move one hour in my code.


### Day 86: April 10, 2020 (Week 1 Done)

**Today's Progress**: The code I made had an error so I had to think of another idea. I ended up implementing a solution from a hint with help from a forum comment.

**Thoughts:** Kind of a down day. I felt a little bit alone.


### Day 87: April 11, 2020 (Dynamic arrays)

**Today's Progress**: Learned about dynamic arrays and how its amortized running time is just O(1), even though its worst case takes O(n). I also review how to use the Python Interactive windows in VS Code. It could save me some time.

**Thoughts:** A really lazy day. Fighting against myself.


### Day 88: April 12, 2020 (Amortized Analysis test)

**Today's Progress**: I took the test on amortized cost and passed it. After that I learned about *args and **kwargs arguments in Python functions. I also read the book to reinforce my knowledge on amortized cost.

**Thoughts:** Another lazy day. It got better at the end though.


### Day 89: April 13, 2020 (Priority Queues)

**Today's Progress**: I learned about priority queues and its implementation using heaps as complete binary trees. I really like how nifty this data structure is.

**Thoughts:** Day full of work. I didn’t find enough time during the day to finish my coding hour. I’m enjoying it, though.


### Day 90: April 14, 2020 (Amortized analysis - Reading)

**Today's Progress**: I learned to use the IPython shell as an alternative to the native shell. It offers a nicer interface and easy control of commands. I used it to make a program for a binary counter to help me understand the examples in the book.

**Thoughts:** I did have some work today. A productive day I’d say. Even though I haven’t code that much I learned to use new tools and practice my programming abilities.


### Day 91: April 15, 2020 (Amortized analysis - Reading)

**Today's Progress**: Just hard reading.

**Thoughts:** A busy day. I couldn’t move much.


### Day 92: April 16, 2020 (Priority queues - Heap sort)

**Today's Progress**: I learned how a heap sort algorithm can work in O(n.log(n)) time without extra space.

**Thoughts:** Another busy day with cooking. I moved what I could, which wasn’t little.


### Day 93: April 17, 2020 (Disjoint sets)

**Today's Progress**: I learned a new data structure. Disjoint sets and its basic operations MakeSet(x), Find(x) and Union(x, y). Also I learned two implementations, one using arrays, linked lists (O(n) operations) and a tree which have logaritmit time operations.

**Thoughts:** An evolution. Great day. Very productive in personal things.


### Day 94: April 18, 2020 (Disjoint sets - Efitien implementation)

**Today's Progress**: Union by rank and path compression. Using these two procedures allows us to have almost constant running time for most inputs.

**Thoughts:** A very productive day. It’s very late though. Time to sleep.


### Day 95: April 19, 2020 (Disjoint sets - Reading)

**Today's Progress**: Getting done with this data structure. After reading I can’t fully understand the proof of the running time. I think I may check it again later.

**Thoughts:** A neutral day. I’m starting to feel bad for working on these hours.


### Day 96: April 20, 2020 (Data Analysis)

**Today's Progress**: I took a break from my course and watched a FreeCodeCamp video on Data Analysis using Python. Also review AWS concepts I wanted to learn.

**Thoughts:** Trying to improve my day organization.


### Day 97: April 21, 2020 (build_heap.py)

**Today's Progress**: I finished the “Convert an array into a heap” problem. Tomorrow I will stress test it.

**Thoughts:** A better day. I haven’t worked out, though.


### Day 98: April 22, 2020 (job_queue.py)

**Today's Progress**: I finished testing the “Convert an array into a heap” problem. It took a bit longer than expected. I also started trying to solve the “Parallel processing” problem. I’m supposed to use a priority queue which I have no idea how to use.

**Thoughts:** A very productive and organized day. Feeling ok.


### Day 99: April 23, 2020 (job_queue.py)

**Today's Progress**: Reading and thinking. I may just use a priority queue for getting the min in log(n) time.

**Thoughts:** A bit down in the afternoon, but manageable.
