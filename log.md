# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 14, 2020 (-to complete-)

**Today's Progress**: Javascript for sending a message automaticaly when someone starts tying on Whatsapp web. Review Github, how to fork and work with it.

**Thoughts:** It was difficult to start. A little bit worried about the future, but it doesn't happend yet so I'll be focusing on the present. This'll be great. Here I go, Google.

### Day 1: January 15, 2020 (WhatsappWeb send when typing)

**Today's Progress**: I worked in yesterday's code improving it with online sources. I learned more about web, but it is definitely not my strenght. I also commit the code to Github and add a little game I did some time ago to improve it as a part of this challege.

**Thoughts:** Feeling great with a lot of energy to keep working on this. A little bit nervous about the problems it may have in the future, but it's manageble.
