# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 14, 2020 (-to complete-)

**Today's Progress**: Javascript for sending a message automaticaly when someone starts tying on Whatsapp web. Review Github, how to fork and work with it.

**Thoughts:** It was difficult to start. A little bit worried about the future, but it doesn't happend yet so I'll be focusing on the present. This'll be great. Here I go, Google.

### Day 1: January 15, 2020 (WhatsappWeb send when typing)

**Today's Progress**: I worked in yesterday's code improving it with online sources. I learned more about web, but it is definitely not my strenght. I also commit the code to Github and add a little game I did some time ago to improve it as a part of this challege.

**Thoughts:** Feeling great with a lot of energy to keep working on this. A little bit nervous about the problems it may have in the future, but it's manageble.

### Day 2: January 16, 2020 ()

**Today's Progress**: Some improvements to the Whatsapp autosend and the random number game. Also investigate and plan on how to run the python code online. For now the workaround is Trinket.io. I'll have my own webapp for that soon.

**Thoughts:** I'm amazed by how well the code was on the random number game and the fact that I did it a long time ago just by myself. Point for me there.
Days seems to be passing slowly, but I know I will keep on the challenge. Today was a tired day. At least I manage to keep on the challenge. Let's sleep now.

### Day 3: January 17, 2020 (Learning Django)

**Today's Progress**: Install Django, read about packages, read and try to poll app in the Django tutorial web.

**Thoughts:** What a day. I struggle to start today but at least I spend some time on coding. Feeling a little bit down.


### Day 4: January 18, 2020 (Django vs Flask)

**Today's Progress**: Very little really. I learn the differences between Flask and Django. I run both "Hello World" webapps. For now I think I'll put apart Django and learn Flask for its simplicity. Tomorrow I'll start learning Flask. I planned that for the end of the next week I'll have my own webapp.

**Thoughts:** It was a day full of activities. I manage to be on top of then and controll all the situations. Now its time to sleep. I'm really tired.

### Day 5: January 19, 2020 (Troubleshooting)

**Today's Progress**: I spend most of the time troubleshooting. I found the Flask tutorial by freeCodeAcademy.org on YouTube but I couldn't finished it yet for the problems I was facing. At least now I know about virtual enviroments, problems with Windows Store Python and decided to use VSCode alonside with Notepad++. Sublime is pretty good, but I can't allow me to spend on it just yet.

**Thoughts:** Long day with some negative thoughts for the problem after problem I faced. At least they didn't last longer. Tomorrow will be a different story.


### Day 6: January 20, 2020 (Starting with Flask)

**Today's Progress**: Continue with the Flask tutorial. I like that it's really fast. I like that challenge, but that also means that I have to pause a lot to read and understant what I'm doing. That 46 minutes tutorial will be a couple of chapters for me ^^u. With all of that I like it.

**Thoughts:** A hard day at work. It draind almost all my energy. My mind didn't help that much neither. Fortunately, I manage to move at least a little bit in my coding path.


### Day 7: January 21, 2020 (Bah)

**Today's Progress**: The Flaks project seems too much. At least for today I couldn't finish it. On the other hand, I learn about Linux ownership and permissions (chown and chmod), install pyinstaller to be able to compile python into executables and learn about 4 types of hosting (self hosting, traditional, free and VPS (cloud?)).

**Thoughts:** What a day. The most down day in a lot of time. The extra things I had to do for work may be the reason.


### Day 8: January 22, 2020 (Not prepare YET. Still recovering.)

**Today's Progress**: I did some researsh on Python and came up to the conclusion that I'm not prepare for learning frameworks like Django or Flask yet. First, I need to master Data Structures and Algorithms. I found many free (and payed) courses online. I toke a glance at some of them and narrow my alternatives down to 3. Tomorrow I'll start with any of those. Now I want to sleep.

**Thoughts:** Still recovering from yesterday terrible day. I feel tired today and couldn't move that much. At least I did my yoga and do some researsh.


### Day 9: January 23, 2020 (Much better. Data Structures and Algoriths)

**Today's Progress**: After a little lot thinking on where to start I finally started with a 6-months coursera specialization, Data Structures and Algorithms. I just started it and so far I looks awesome. I reviewed also a little bit of discrete math, which basics are needed for the course. I think I've learned in college, but not with that name.

**Thoughts:** I feel better with the help of my love. Day was a bit hard and with few time (it's 1:24am right now), but now everything seems ok.


### Day 10: January 24, 2020 (Discrete Maths and Data Structures and Algoriths)

**Today's Progress**: Review some discrete maths concepts and move on the course. I now know what is a stress test. Tomorrow I will implement it.

**Thoughts:** Day full of activities (battery, psy, Ayr). It was a great day. I'm feeling full of energies. I'd make more hours of code, but I need to rest.


### Day 11: January 25, 2020 (Fibbonaci)

**Today's Progress**: Learn to stress test and probe an algorithm works for many cases. Also review the Fibbonaci series and how it grows more quickly than 2^(n/2) (demostrated by induction) The course is getting pretty academic. I love it!

**Thoughts:** Another great day. I feel a little worried for the time not being enough for my codeing hour. Well, it's 1:24 am ._.


### Day 12: January 26, 2020 (Big-O)

**Today's Progress**: Algorithms efficiency and Big-O notation. I dive into the math part of Big-O notation. I'm really liking how technically this course allow me to be.

**Thoughts:** A sunday. I wanted to rest, but I also want to study. At the end I gave a little bit more than an hour to studying. :)


### Day 13: January 27, 2020 (Big-Theta)

**Today's Progress**: Big-theta. I spend the hole hour demostrating Big-Theta of a geometrical series. Amazing and tyring.

**Thoughts:** Something unconfortable at home change my mood. A little bit down... again.


### Day 14: January 28, 2020 (Fibonacci proves)

**Today's Progress**: Trying some Fibonacci proves. I couldn't make it.

**Thoughts:** I don't remember. I think I was better than yesterday.


### Day 15: January 29, 2020 (Fibonacci proves... again)

**Today's Progress**: I found the proves I couldn't find yesterfay.

**Thoughts:** I feel... ok. Not bad, not good. I felt great after finding the solutions I couldn't do myself yesterdey.



### Day 16: January 30, 2020 (Google Cloud Platform / Matrixes for Fibonacci)

**Today's Progress**: Signed up for GCP (free $300 for a year) and set up a virtual server. I think I'll be hosting something simple there soon. I also reviewed the algorithms book's missing exercises. I have an idea for all of them but the last. Tomorrow I will write them down and continue with the next chapter in the course.

**Thoughts:** Feeling tired from yesterday, but I found energy to study.


### Day 17: January 31, 2020 (Euclidean Algorithm)

**Today's Progress**: Euclidean Algorithm. I did it on nano. Pretty good. :)

**Thoughts:** Feeling really tired for not sleeping well this last two days.


### Day 18: February 01, 2020 (Problem solving and reading)

**Today's Progress**: Discuss an elegant way to prove the number of matrices multiplications. Read a little bit more about the Euclid's algorithm. And also make a little program that prints Fib numbers (the algorithm that uses an array) to visualize it and explain it. Now I have my screen filled with a fib number. ^^u

**Thoughts:** It was a great day. I have a great time with my special one :).


### Day 19: February 02, 2020 (Reviewing Asimptotic Notation)

**Today's Progress**: Review aimptotic notation in the course. It's the last part of the second week of it. I also learn some Jupiter and how to use the python's numpy and matplotlib libraries.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good, a little tired and the beggining but good after all. Today I finish early. It's 9pm. :D


### Day 20: February 03, 2020 (Quizes and first real assigment)

**Today's Progress**: I did some quizes and solve the first problem of my first real assigment. Still basic algorithms.

**Thoughts:** It was a good day meeting an old friend after a long time. It's good to have good friends supporting you. :)


### Day 21: February 04, 2020 (fibonacci_last_digit.py)

**Today's Progress**: Learn to plot histograms with Pandas. Also finish the second assignment of 8 I have to do. I think I need to speed things up, but I’m really enjoying learning each one very well and understanding everything. It has always paid me back. 

**Thoughts:** Kind of a sluggish day. It wasn't that bad at the end.

### Day 22: February 05, 2020 (gcd.py & lcm.py)

**Today's Progress**: Program to calculate gcd efficiently. I did it in advance so I just had to adapt it. Program to calculate the lcm. My gcd program helped me with that. I stress test both to become more familiar with testing. Also I have the code for fibonacci_huge.py almost complete.

**Thoughts:** What a day at work. I was falling asleep every half and hour. The office was terribly hot. That may be the reason. At last my code entertain me a lot.


### Day 23: February 06, 2020 (fibonacci_huge.py)

**Today's Progress**: As I got inscrived in the course I started sending my past assignments (and correcting those first 2 I thought were ready). Also finish the 5th of the 8 assignments of the Week 2 of the course, the fibonacci_huge! :D. 

**Thoughts:** Bguag day... Although, it had a good new at the end. I get financial aid for the course I’m in right now.

### Day 24: February 07, 2020 (3 x Last digit of the sum of Fibonacci numbers)

**Today's Progress**: Finist the homework! And all was correct 8/8. Last digit of the sum of Fibonacci numbers, last digit of the partial sum, last digit of the sum of the squares :D. Also started with the week 3, greedy algorithms.

**Thoughts:** I started the day with more energy than yesterday. Maybe looking at one  of my passions, video games, helps me find an intention for the day.

### Day 25: February 08, 2020 (Greedy Algorithm)

**Today's Progress**: Continue with Greedy Algorithms. Learn its basic principles. I also read about partitions to understand part of a problem. I didn’t know them till now. Pretty appealing math stuff.

**Thoughts:** A better day. It's the weekend and I managed my free time pretty well. I didn’t want to study much today so I limited my practice to just a little bit more than an hour. Feeling good.


### Day 26: February 09, 2020 (Greedy Algorithm)

**Today's Progress**: I finished greedy algorithms theory lessons and review the next assignment.

**Thoughts:** Another “neh” day. I didn’t manage to finish all my activities early… That makes me feel bad. Also, today I didn’t like doing anything, but I did much.., whatever...


### Day 27: February 10, 2020 (Money change problem)

**Today's Progress**: I did the first problem of my assignment and test it (I didn't stress test it though), Money change. Also understand sys module in Python. Finally, I got some work in advance for the next problem.
 
**Thoughts:** A hard day. My laptop didn't turn on when I got home and that make me feel sad. I just wanted to sleep after that and that's what I did.


### Day 28: February 11, 2020 (Fractional Knapsack)

**Today's Progress**: I finished my Fractional Knapsack problem. 2/7 ready. I couldn't find more time at work to do more.

**Thoughts:** A better day. Some troubles with time, but manageable. The night was better playing with my cousin.


### Day 29: February 12, 2020 (Car refill)

**Today's Progress**: At least advance a bit with the solution of the car refill problem. Also review some Linux installations docs.

**Thoughts:** No words.


### Day 30: February 13, 2020 (Car refill)

**Today's Progress**: Having trouble with the car refill algorithm implementation. Perfectionism played against me.

**Thoughts:** The clouds dissipated during the day and the day got better by evening. Did anyone notice the pattern?
