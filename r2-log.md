# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 2

The log of my #100DaysOfCode - Round 2 challenge. Started on [Saturday April 25th, 2020].

## Log

### Day 1: April 25, 2020 (Starting a new round - job_queue.py finished)

**Today's Progress**: The bug was where I expected it. I debugged it and tested the code. It’s working fine. I also watched a conference on the Python’s Pytest module. I think I’m gonna start using it for testing my code. It may be useful in the future with larger projects.

**Thoughts:** I’m getting organized again. That’s great. Feeling powerful.

### Day 2: April 26, 2020 (merging_tables.py)

**Today's Progress**: The merging tables problem looked really intimidating at first. It is just an implementation of disjoint sets. I have some code finish, but not complete yet.

**Thoughts:** Kind of a hard day. It was a Sunday and I let myself rest, relax and not work that hard. Feeling ok.


### Day 3: April 27, 2020 (merging_tables.py)

**Today's Progress**: I finished the merging tables problem. For testing it I used pytest. I also started with the next week’s content, hashing! I also start playing with pandas and JSON APIs. Tomorrow I’ll give it another peek.

**Thoughts:** Feeling ok. Normal routinary day.


### Day 4: April 28, 2020 (Pandas and AWS)

**Today's Progress**: I took a break from the course to learn a bit more of pandas, json apis and AWS. Cloud computing is an interesting and broad field. I may take a course on that.

**Thoughts:** Less than ok day. It’s late.
