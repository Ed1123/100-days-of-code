# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 2

The log of my #100DaysOfCode - Round 2 challenge. Started on [Saturday April 25th, 2020].

## Log

### Day 1: April 25, 2020 (Starting a new round - job_queue.py finished)

**Today's Progress**: The bug was where I expected it. I debugged it and tested the code. It’s working fine. I also watched a conference on the Python’s Pytest module. I think I’m gonna start using it for testing my code. It may be useful in the future with larger projects.

**Thoughts:** I’m getting organized again. That’s great. Feeling powerful.

**Link to work:** [Python Testing 101 with pytest - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etosV2IWBF0)


### Day 2: April 26, 2020 (merging_tables.py)

**Today's Progress**: The merging tables problem looked really intimidating at first. It is just an implementation of disjoint sets. I have some code finish, but not complete yet.

**Thoughts:** Kind of a hard day. It was a Sunday and I let myself rest, relax and not work that hard. Feeling ok.


### Day 3: April 27, 2020 (merging_tables.py)

**Today's Progress**: I finished the merging tables problem. For testing it I used pytest. I also started with the next week’s content, hashing! I also start playing with pandas and JSON APIs. Tomorrow I’ll give it another peek.

**Thoughts:** Feeling ok. Normal routinary day.


### Day 4: April 28, 2020 (Pandas and AWS)

**Today's Progress**: I took a break from the course to learn a bit more of pandas, json apis and AWS. Cloud computing is an interesting and broad field. I may take a course on that.

**Thoughts:** Less than ok day. It’s late.


### Day 5: April 29, 2020 (Hash)

**Today's Progress**: Sets, maps and hash tables. I got a bit lost today. I hope that by reading I understand better this topic cause I consider it very important.

**Thoughts:** An ok day. I move, little, but it is something.


### Day 6: April 30, 2020 (SQL and reading hash)

**Today's Progress**: I watched a live coding video on modeling and implementing SQL databases that refreshed and polished up my knowledge on them. It also helped reinforce my basic understanding of AWS and Docker containers. I also took some time to read the books to better understand hashing tables. Now I think I have a better picture of them.

**Thoughts:** A very productive day cleaning. I did what I had to and a bit more. Feeling good. :)


### Day 7: May 1, 2020 (Reading hash)

**Today's Progress**: Hashin tables’ proofs are maths I don’t understand that well. This example exercise resumes some of my frustration.
![Exercise from companion book](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EW_vjaJWsAAfKuh?format=png&name=small)

**Thoughts:** I almost slept all day. Hope tomorrow will be a better day.


### Day 8: May 2, 2020 (Universal family)

**Today's Progress**: I learned how hash tables use hash functions from universal families to compute its operations in constant time average. For defining a universal family for hashing integers I learned to use prime numbers.

**Thoughts:** A down day. Negative thoughts everywhere.


### Day 9: May 3, 2020 (Starting with Julia and math proofs)

**Today's Progress**: I get to know Julia. It looks really promising. I also looked at mathematical expectation and modular arithmetic to better understand the proofs demonstrating for the average running time of universal families.

**Thoughts:** Another down day.


### Day 10: May 4, 2020 (Download Julia and hashing strings)

**Today's Progress**: Download Julia to start learning it with its tutorials notebooks. Before all of that I came across a lot of debugging. Understandable. I couldn’t solve all the issues today. I also learned to hash strings. Basically convert them to ints (using ASCII or Unicode) and use polynomial hashing.

**Thoughts:** Another down day.


### Day 11: May 5, 2020 (Finished debugging and start learning Julia)

**Today's Progress**: I finished debugging my Julia installation and started running the tutorial notebooks. So far I’m really liking the notation of the language. I hope it evolves as Python did. It really looks promising.

**Thoughts:** Another even downish day.


### Day 12: May 6, 2020 (Julia data structures and hashing reading)

**Today's Progress**: Learning to use the different data structures provided by Julia. In the course I started reading the book with the hashing concepts to reinforce my knowledge.

**Thoughts:** Another down day, but I make it better by doing yoga and giving me space to work and relax what I want to.


### Day 13: May 7, 2020 (Universal Hashing)

**Today's Progress**: Reading universal hashing. Kind of stuck in the proofs. A professor would help.

**Thoughts:** Another down day, but a little bit better. Just a little bit.


### Day 14: May 8, 2020 (Rabin-Karp’s algorithm and plotting in Julia)

**Today's Progress**: I passed the hash functions test and started with the pattern searching algorithm of Rabin-Karp. The idea is to use hashing and chaining to avoid searching and checking each character multiple times.
About plotting with Julia. I have another bug. Tomorrow I’ll check it.


### Day 15: May 9, 2020 (Rabin-Karp’s algorithm)

**Today's Progress**: The proof of Rabin-Karp’s algorithm running time is certainly complicated. Fortunately by reading I’m understanding it more.
About plotting with Julia… I couldn’t catch the bug yet, but I didn’t give that much time.

**Thoughts:** Feeling better. I would say I was ok today.


### Day 16: May 10, 2020 (Numbers theory)

**Today's Progress**: Reading some basic numbers theory to better understand the underline proofs of Rabin-Karp. Equivalence of two numbers modulo a third number.

![Handnotes picture](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EXuBECfWkAEW-Nx?format=jpg&name=900x900)

**Thoughts:** A slow day, but interesting in my learning hour.


### Day 17: May 11, 2020 (The Rabin-Karp algorithm)

**Today's Progress**: Just reading for a deeper understanding and a different view of the algorithm.

**Thoughts:** A super productive day. Feeling really good.


### Day 18: May 12, 2020 (Distributed hash tables and consistent hashing)

**Today's Progress**: Learning about distributed hash tables and consistent hashing. Useful for distributing loads and allowing scalability for big data.

**Thoughts:** A super down day.


### Day 19: May 13, 2020 (Coding phone_book.py)

**Today's Progress**: Started to code the phone_book.py (1 of 6 programming challenges of my programming assignment). I have to only use direct addressing. I have the code almost done. I also have the pytest tests ready for tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** A better day. I managed to do more.


### Day 20: May 14, 2020 (Coding hash_chains.py)

**Today's Progress**: Finished coding and submitting the phone_book.py problem. Now started working on the next, the hash_chains (2 of 6 programming challenges of my programming assignment). I’m asked to use a hash table with chaining for this. Implementing it is not that difficult but understanding the starting code given to me took a bit of time.
Also recheck my git knowledge by trying to work locally. I don’t remember some details that I’ll work with tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** A better day. It was very productive. Feeling good. :)


### Day 21: May 15, 2020 (Coding hash_chains.py)

**Today's Progress**: The code for hash_chains works but I need to test it before submitting it.
Today I also finished my local copy of my Github repository. I needed to review some terms I'd forgotten.

**Thoughts:** Not that productive as yesterday, but still feeling good and with energy. :)


### Day 22: May 16, 2020 (Testing hash_chains.py)

**Today's Progress**: It was a bussy day. I did some advancements, though. I created the tests for the problem. Now I know how to capture the output in pytest to use it as part of the test. I'm missing the larger test with a file provided.

**Thoughts:** Manage to do a lot today. I'm proud of myself. Feeling good again.


### Day 23: May 17, 2020 (Reading for hash_substring)

**Today's Progress**: I finished testing the hash_chains problem and submited it. Also started with the hash_substring problem. I have to implement the Rabin-Karp's algorithm. For that I needed to review the book chapter about it cause I left behind some important details.

**Thoughts:** Even thoug I haven't done much today I'm ok beacause it is what I chosed to do. I had a good day.


### Day 24: May 18, 2020 (Reading for hash_substring)

**Today's Progress**: The section I didn’t understand very well was the one of the recurrence when calculating the polynomial hash of the segments of the text of leng of the patern being searched. Other concept I have more clear now is that the choose of a random hashing function from the hashing family is done once at the beggining of the algorithm. That way all the hashes correspond to each other (same is done in hashing tables I think).
I also read about markup languages. In particular I was interested in markdown and LaTex. I've learned a lot about them. I might start using more markdown (or LaTex) soon.

**Thoughts:** It wasn't such a nice day as yesterday was, but still good.


### Day 25: May 19, 2020 (Coding hash_substring)

**Today's Progress**: I completed the code for the problem and write the tests I'll perform. So far, the code didn’t pass any test.
I was also readding about Wox and Listary (and UELI) as softwares for Windows. I was interested in Wox as a open source project I may start contributing to, but Listary has many more features and it's a steep ahead. I don't know what to do. At least I now know that I can find some open source projects on Github to contribite if I can.

**Thoughts:** Not a great day. I'd say an ok day.


### Day 26: May 20, 2020 (Submitting hash_substring, Git and Hashing test)

**Today's Progress**: The problem in the code was a +1 and a -1 in wrong places. The rest was correct.
Today I also read a bit more about GitHub certificates (a bit too complex for me for now) and how my local copies of repos are organized. I don't think a folder name "x" inside a folder equally named is the most correct way of doing it.
Finally I took a little test on hashing. Pretty interesting questions.

**Thoughts:** Not a bad day. Facing personal problems and finding creative solutions give you a nice feeling of superation.

### Day 27: May 21, 2020 (GitHub, Wiki & substring_equality)

**Today's Progress**: Basically jumping around many things. Started the *mini* course Communicating using Markdown on [lab.github.com](https://lab.github.com). I also finished my reading on how Wiki is a markup language and how it got created.

I also read to complete the hashing substring problem. I have a very clear idea of how to make it. I just need to implement it.

**Thoughts:** Getting through the day as good as I can.


### Day 28: May 22, 2020 (substring_equality)

**Today's Progress**: I dedicated all my coding time to code and test the substring_equality problem. It seems to work in the only test sample I was provided with, but I need to further test it with an stress test.

**Thoughts:** Starting to feel better thanks to an external help.


### Day 29: May 23, 2020 (Debugging substring_equality)

**Today's Progress**: The substring_equality problem worked, but it was running too slow. Apparently my function for computing exponentiations with modulo efficiently wasn't efficient enough. Actually, python exponentiation built-in function, pow(), works much faster than my manually defined function when working with large number. The manually define function reduces the number to its modulo each step, but it seemed to be not enough for the test. According to [Sven Marnach](https://stackoverflow.com/users/279627/sven-marnach) in this answer in [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/5246975/10864988), pow() is much faster because it uses binary exponentiation besides reducing to the modulo on each step.
After that I read the next problem. Find the longest common substring, but this time using hashing functions instead of dynamic programing. Looks a bit intimidating.

**Thoughts:** Starting to make me feel better. It's difficult, though.

### Day 30: May 24, 2020 (Markdown and GitHub)

**Today's Progress**: 

- Reading about the capabilities of markdown and LaTeX:
  - Thesis in LaTeX or markdown: https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/419464
  - https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown
  - https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown
- GitHub Lab:
  - Markdown lists
  - GitHub Pages
  - Headers
  - Branches

**Thoughts:** Bad day that fortunately is over.

### Day 31: May 25, 2020 (Communicating using Markdown)

**Today's Progress**: Finish the markdown course on GitHub. I needed a pause from the hard work in the Data Structures and Algorithms course and this was the perfect simple alternative for a couple of days. I learned to use markdown and GitHub better. I know even know that there is a thing called GitHub Pages.

**Thoughts:** Recovering.

**Link to work**: [My GitHub portfolio](https://ed1123.github.io/markdown-portfolio)

### Day 32: May 26, 2020 (Videoconferencing & common_substring problem)

**Today's Progress**: Getting informed in my videoconference software options for a personal projects with my mom who is a teacher. I also resume my course with the common_substring problem. As I said before, I looks overwhelming and it is a little bit yet, but I'm facing it. Now I'm reading for help in the discussions forums and find a link to a Quora article that seems have some pretty good insights for my understanding of the solution. It's enough for today, though. I feel I'm still recovering and I don't feel like doing it all today. At least I resume it.

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling with no that much energy. I feel like I'm still recovering. I'm moving forward, though. :slightly_smiling_face:

### Day 33: May 27, 2020 (Coding common_substring)

**Today's Progress**: The Quora article was clear enough to realize how to apply binary search in the problem. With that help, I have 80% of the code finished. I need to implement a simple hash table. I think I'm gonna use a class for that. Tomorrow I'll see.

**Thoughts:** Not that good of a start but I manage to move the most that I could. Feeling ok, but I feel I'm still recovering slowly.

### Day 34: May 28, 2020 (Coding common_substring)

**Today's Progress**: Code finished but I don't think it's working. I need to modify the format of the result to match what is being ask. At least I have already implemented the hash table class.

**Thoughts:** Great start and following hours. I didn't find time for working out today, but it was ok because I valuable time with my love one. Starting to feel better.

### Day 35: May 29, 2020 (Debug and submit common_substring)

**Today's Progress**: Debugging day. What a mess. I made my code work to perfection defining almost everything manually, including a hashing table. Unfortunately, my implementation of a hash table seems too slow compare to the Python built-in one. My code passes the time limit only when I change my hash table for a python dictionary. At least I have the fulfillment of making that huge code work using my own coded hash table. :)

I also read about Kivy to develop cross platform apps with just Python.

**Thoughts:** Improving. I hope this wellbeing doesn't go anywhere soon. It's 7:49pm and I already have coded for more than 2 hours. It is enough for today.

### Day 36: May 30, 2020 (Coding matching_with_mismatches)

**Today's Progress**: Analyzing and coding the last problem of this segment. I have a good idea of how to implement a solution, but there are some details I haven't figured out just yet. Just need a little bit more time to finished it.

**Thoughts:** An ok day. It wasn't that good, neither that good. I felt low energy.

### Day 37: May 31, 2020 (Docker)

**Today's Progress**: I finally give a try to Docker containers by trying to run local server of Jit.si to make videocalls. It works! I can't believe I make it work. This's a small incremental step, but it's very important for me. I understand more of virtualization and Docker uses.

**Thoughts:** A better day. Feeling good. :)

### Day 38: June 1, 2020 (Reading WSL2 and coding matching_with_mismatches)

**Today's Progress**: Reading about the scope of the Windows Subsystem for Linux.
In my coding program I make a naïve algorithm for the problem. I also coded the tests. That'll make easy to test the main program when it's done.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good. Playing and being productive. :smile:

### Day 39: June 2, 2020 (coding matching_with_mismatches)

**Today's Progress**: The code is not finished yet. It's being kind of hard to code. May be it's just than I'm tired.

**Thoughts:** Tiring and a bit overwhelmed day. Feeling a little bit stressed out, but ok overall.

### Day 40: June 3, 2020 (Still coding matching_with_mismatches)

**Today's Progress**: I'm making little progress. I solve the issue of implementing the binary search, but I have another one with the order or the functions and scope of variables.

**Thoughts:** An "eh" day. Feeling ok.

### Day 41: June 4, 2020 (Reading WebRTC and finished matching_with_mismatches)

**Today's Progress**: Reading about WebRTC and how currently it is the most secure option when it comes to video and voice calls on internet.
[webrtc-security.github.io](https://webrtc-security.github.io/)
Also finally I finished coding the matching_with_mismatches problem. It passed the test on my computer, but, unfortunately, it didn't on the submission. Tomorrow I have time to debug it.

**Thoughts:** Another "eh" day. Feeling better than yesterday, though. I'm sleeping early today. :smile:

### Day 42: June 5, 2020 (Debug matching_with_mismatches)

**Today's Progress**: Tried to debug my algorithm but I couldn't. It passes all the tests on my computer, even stress tests, but it didn't a specific test during submission. I may try it later, but for now I have to move on in the course.

**Thoughts:** Same than yesterday, but a little better. Feeling a little bit sad for not being able to fix my code, but ok overall since I did it all on my own and it worked well on my machine at least.

### Day 43: June 6, 2020 (Terminal & Binary search trees)

**Today's Progress**: I've being learning about shells, terminals, consoles, terminal emulators and so on. [This](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/WhatsTheDifferenceBetweenAConsoleATerminalAndAShell.aspx) nice article help me get many things clear. I get some practice with JSON files and how a schema in VS Code can help with autocompletion and some other features.

In my course I started with binary search trees. The implementation seems simple. I only have to learn how to apply rotations to keep the tree balance and maintain the running time logarithmic.

**Thoughts:** An ok day. I haven't worked out, but I did some pretty stuff while playing with Windows Terminal. :)

### Day 44: June 7, 2020 (Reading Binary search trees)

**Today's Progress**: Just reading how binary search trees need to be balance to ensure logarithmic running time on its operations.

**Thoughts:** I didn't wake up early, but I moved enough the rest of the day to make the day valuable.

### Day 45: June 8, 2020 (Treaps & AVL trees)

**Today's Progress**: I learned that in order to maintain a BST balanced we can use a random heap value attached to the node as on Treaps (tree + heap) or use AVL trees (`|N.left.height - N.right.height| <= 1`). For both rotations are used to move nodes when modifying the tree either by inserting a new node or deleting another. Both ensure also logarithmic running time on its procedures.

**Thoughts:** An ok day. I moved and did many things, but I was a little bit stressed by the time, the fact that I didn't wake up early and that I'm not going to sleep yet (3:33 am (I just saw the time :scream: )).

### Day 46: June 9, 2020 (Microsoft Build 2020)

**Today's Progress**: I take a day from data structures and to focus on caching up with the Microsoft Build sessions I missed. I feel inspired to do some ML with Azure I may start it tomorrow, I have time :). It looks more attractive than AWS for me for some reason. Maybe because it seems to be more accessible.
I also finished the configuration (and the know it all process) of my Windows Terminal. It looks nice and I like it.

**Thoughts:** I wake up late, but I made a reasonable amount of stuff of my day. Feeling relief and ok. I worry why I'm not having those super up days :thinking:.

### Day 47: June 10, 2020 (Finishing AVL trees)

**Today's Progress**: I took the last lessons on AVL trees. I learned that split and merge operations are also possible in this structure. I think the more useful property would be to be able to split the tree in two parts correspondingly bigger and smaller than a given number in logarithmic time.
I'm also looking to finally get a Raspberry Pi 4 (with a kit because I'm lazy enough to not get the parts to make the projects I want) or a kit for my Arduino board I have lying around. I should never give up on this little projects I'd like to do even if it's just for fun. Doing them will give me a whole lot of satisfaction, like my toys did when I was a kid. This'd be like toys for my grown up inner child :smiley:.

**Thoughts:** I woke up earlier than yesterday! :D I felt terribly tired during the day, though. I think it is just for the routine I'm maintaining. On the emotional side, I'm feeling well. I feel a bit anxious for the coding projects I have in mind. I think they might be because of the stress I put on time and that I want to know it all. I can't know it all in little time, but I'm moving on my pace and learning every single day something new. I hope that would take me that somewhere I'd like to be someday.

### Day 48: June 11, 2020 (Applications and more conferences)

**Today's Progress**: I'm reading an understanding the extra functions we can make a balanced binary search tree perform by just adding a size attribute to each node. For instance, finding the ith smallest element and a the rank of any other node in logarithmic time. Awesome.
Also watched more conferences of the Microsoft Build. This guy, Scott Hanselman, did such a great job with his sessions. Amazing stuff. Pretty entertain, inspiring and full of relevant content.

**Thoughts:** It's a bit late, but I'm feeling good. Yoga have became such an important part of my everyday well-being. Namaste. :)

### Day 49: June 12, 2020 (Splay trees)

**Today's Progress**: Learning about another binary search tree called splay trees. The important thing to notice its operations take O(nlogn) time for n operations, so logarithmic time in average, but more frequently access nodes will cost less to look up.

**Thoughts:** Feeling ok. Not that of a productive day, but it was ok. I read a lot, look for things to buy and look for jobs on Microsoft Careers website. 

### Day 50: June 13, 2020 (Splay trees and last homework)

**Today's Progress**: I finished with the splay trees section on the course. It was the last. I also got 100% in the last test. Finally, I started with the homework. So far I was asked to program an in-order, pre-order and post-order traversal of binary trees. I shouldn't be that complicated, but I don't remember the implementation very well right now. I now tomorrow I'll do it without a problem.

**Thoughts:** Not a bad a day. I waken up pretty early, but sleep most of the day. I manage to do my routine work out and that give energy and good mood for the day. Feeling good. :smile:

### Day 51: June 14, 2020 (Tree traversal done)

**Today's Progress**: I needed a bit of help but it was ok. The program works as expected. I also learned to pipe the files using bash in Ubuntu WSL2 and PowerShell on Windows to test the sample file I was given with.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good. I'm getting my Pi soon! :happy:

### Day 52: June 15, 2020 (is_bst.py)

**Today's Progress**: Solving the second problem. I was asked to, given a binary tree, tell if it is a binary search tree or not. I think I have a good structure of the code now. I just got stuck in the deciding how to implement the tree class itself.

**Thoughts:** Not a great day. I felt too tired and sick, but I'm getting better. Feeling a bit down but ok overall.

### Day 53: June 16, 2020 (debugging is_bst.py)

**Today's Progress**: I focused on finishing my is_bst code. I did gave up on implementing new classes for the tree and nodes because the trees where already given in a structure and converting them to nodes objects would've created memory and time overhead and would've been a lose of time. A better solution could have been implementing a node object and populate the tree as the program reads the input instead of using the tree array that was the default in the starter file.
The code works, but I need further testing before submitting it.

**Thoughts:** What a day. I didn't want to get out of bed. My day started pretty late, but I got move and finished a long-awaited matter. Feeling ok at the end of the day. Life is being hard these days.

### Day 54: June 17, 2020 (is_bst.py)

**Today's Progress**: My code works with my little examples, but not when submitting it. I suspect it is related with stack overflow for the recursions, even though I'm taking care of it. I need a way to generate valid binary search trees to test then against my code and see what happens.

**Thoughts:** Feeling a bit down for not being able to move more quickly through my course. I'm gonna let it there and just try to sleep. I hope tomorrow will be a better day.

### Day 55: June 18, 2020 (is_bst.py finally done)

**Today's Progress**: I made my code work. The error wasn't in my code though. The starter file set a too small threading for my code to work properly.
Moving to the next problem which is the same only that now there may be duplicate keys.

**Thoughts:** Life is being hard these days. I'm not feeling super good long ago. I wonder what's wrong. Feeling ok-.

### Day 56: June 19, 2020 (set_range_sum.py)

**Today's Progress**: My code worked for the next problem with just a minor modification (adding an equal sign) so I passed it and moved to the next one. In this problem an splay tree is given to modified it to make it capable of perform range sums quickly. I review splay tree lectures and read and understand the code before attempting any modification. I needed to clarify how rotations are performed.

**Thoughts:** Not that good yet, but I'm managing to at least move the minimum that I must. It is late already, but my coding hour is done along with other pending tasks.

### Day 57: June 20, 2020 (Coding splay tree operations)

**Today's Progress**: I spend the hour reading code, reviewing slides and coding operations of the splay tree. Currently working on the next vertex operation.

**Thoughts:** Feeling a lot better. I haven't done much today. Playing Zelda, reading articles, trying to fix the problem with my mouse and reviewing a master in CS ($15k!). But I feel good. I hope I can fix my scheduled soon.



### Day : June , 2020 ()

**Today's Progress**: 

**Thoughts:**
