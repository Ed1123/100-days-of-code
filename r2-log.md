# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 2

The log of my #100DaysOfCode - Round 2 challenge. Started on [Saturday April 25th, 2020].

## Log

### Day 1: April 25, 2020 (Starting a new round - job_queue.py finished)

**Today's Progress**: The bug was where I expected it. I debugged it and tested the code. It’s working fine. I also watched a conference on the Python’s Pytest module. I think I’m gonna start using it for testing my code. It may be useful in the future with larger projects.

**Thoughts:** I’m getting organized again. That’s great. Feeling powerful.

**Link to work:** [Python Testing 101 with pytest - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etosV2IWBF0)


### Day 2: April 26, 2020 (merging_tables.py)

**Today's Progress**: The merging tables problem looked really intimidating at first. It is just an implementation of disjoint sets. I have some code finish, but not complete yet.

**Thoughts:** Kind of a hard day. It was a Sunday and I let myself rest, relax and not work that hard. Feeling ok.


### Day 3: April 27, 2020 (merging_tables.py)

**Today's Progress**: I finished the merging tables problem. For testing it I used pytest. I also started with the next week’s content, hashing! I also start playing with pandas and JSON APIs. Tomorrow I’ll give it another peek.

**Thoughts:** Feeling ok. Normal routinary day.


### Day 4: April 28, 2020 (Pandas and AWS)

**Today's Progress**: I took a break from the course to learn a bit more of pandas, json apis and AWS. Cloud computing is an interesting and broad field. I may take a course on that.

**Thoughts:** Less than ok day. It’s late.


### Day 5: April 29, 2020 (Hash)

**Today's Progress**: Sets, maps and hash tables. I got a bit lost today. I hope that by reading I understand better this topic cause I consider it very important.

**Thoughts:** An ok day. I move, little, but it is something.


### Day 6: April 30, 2020 (SQL and reading hash)

**Today's Progress**: I watched a live coding video on modeling and implementing SQL databases that refreshed and polished up my knowledge on them. It also helped reinforce my basic understanding of AWS and Docker containers. I also took some time to read the books to better understand hashing tables. Now I think I have a better picture of them.

**Thoughts:** A very productive day cleaning. I did what I had to and a bit more. Feeling good. :)


### Day 7: May 1, 2020 (Reading hash)

**Today's Progress**: Hashin tables’ proofs are maths I don’t understand that well. This example exercise resumes some of my frustration.

**Thoughts:** I almost slept all day. Hope tomorrow will be a better day.


### Day 8: May 2, 2020 (Universal family)

**Today's Progress**: I learned how hash tables use hash functions from universal families to compute its operations in constant time average. For defining a universal family for hashing integers I learned to use prime numbers.

**Thoughts:** A down day. Negative thoughts everywhere.


### Day 9: May 3, 2020 (Starting with Julia and math proofs)

**Today's Progress**: I get to know Julia. It looks really promising. I also looked at mathematical expectation and modular arithmetic to better understand the proofs demonstrating for the average running time of universal families.

**Thoughts:** Another down day.


### Day 10: May 4, 2020 (Download Julia and hashing strings)

**Today's Progress**: Download Julia to start learning it with its tutorials notebooks. Before all of that I came across a lot of debugging. Understandable. I couldn’t solve all the issues today. I also learned to hash strings. Basically convert them to ints (using ASCII or Unicode) and use polynomial hashing.

**Thoughts:** Another down day.


### Day 11: May 5, 2020 (Finished debugging and start learning Julia)

**Today's Progress**: I finished debugging my Julia installation and started running the tutorial notebooks. So far I’m really liking the notation of the language. I hope it evolves as Python did. It really looks promising.

**Thoughts:** Another even downish day.


### Day 12: May 6, 2020 (Julia data structures and hashing reading)

**Today's Progress**: Learning to use the different data structures provided by Julia. In the course I started reading the book with the hashing concepts to reinforce my knowledge.

**Thoughts:** Another down day, but I make it better by doing yoga and giving me space to work and relax what I want to.


### Day 13: May 7, 2020 (Universal Hashing)

**Today's Progress**: Reading universal hashing. Kind of stuck in the proofs. A professor would help.

**Thoughts:** Another down day, but a little bit better. Just a little bit.


### Day 14: May 8, 2020 (Rabin-Karp’s algorithm and plotting in Julia)

**Today's Progress**: I passed the hash functions test and started with the pattern searching algorithm of Rabin-Karp. The idea is to use hashing and chaining to avoid searching and checking each character multiple times.
About plotting with Julia. I have another bug. Tomorrow I’ll check it.


### Day 15: May 9, 2020 (Rabin-Karp’s algorithm)

**Today's Progress**: The proof of Rabin-Karp’s algorithm running time is certainly complicated. Fortunately by reading I’m understanding it more.
About plotting with Julia… I couldn’t catch the bug yet, but I didn’t give that much time.

**Thoughts:** Feeling better. I would say I was ok today.


### Day 16: May 10, 2020 (Numbers theory)

**Today's Progress**: Reading some basic numbers theory to better understand the underline proofs of Rabin-Karp. Equivalence of two numbers modulo a third number.

**Thoughts:** A slow day, but interesting in my learning hour.


### Day 17: May 11, 2020 (The Rabin-Karp algorithm)

**Today's Progress**: Just reading for a deeper understanding and a different view of the algorithm.

**Thoughts:** A super productive day. Feeling really good.


### Day 18: May 12, 2020 (Distributed hash tables and consistent hashing)

**Today's Progress**: Learning about distributed hash tables and consistent hashing. Useful for distributing loads and allowing scalability for big data.

**Thoughts:** A super down day.


### Day 19: May 13, 2020 (Coding phone_book.py)

**Today's Progress**: Started to code the phone_book.py (1 of 6 programming challenges of my programming assignment). I have to only use direct addressing. I have the code almost done. I also have the pytest tests ready for tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** A better day. I managed to do more.


### Day 20: May 14, 2020 (Coding hash_chains.py)

**Today's Progress**: Finished coding and submitting the phone_book.py problem. Now started working on the next, the hash_chains (2 of 6 programming challenges of my programming assignment). I’m asked to use a hash table with chaining for this. Implementing it is not that difficult but understanding the starting code given to me took a bit of time.
Also recheck my git knowledge by trying to work locally. I don’t remember some details that I’ll work with tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** A better day. It was very productive. Feeling good. :)
